Normally , server run specific computer socket bind specific port number . The server wait , listen socket client make connection request . On client-side : The client know hostname machine server run port number server listen . To make connection request , client try rendezvous server server 's machine port . The client also need identify server bind local port number use connection . This usually assign system . If everything go well , server accept connection . Upon acceptance , server get new socket bound local port also remote endpoint set address port client . It need new socket continue listen original socket connection request tend need connected client . On client side , connection accept , socket successfully create client use socket communicate server . The client server communicate write read socket . Definition : A socket one endpoint two-way communication link two program run network . A socket bind port number TCP layer identify application data destine send . An endpoint combination IP address port number . Every TCP connection uniquely identify two endpoint . That way multiple connection host server . The java.net package Java platform provide class , Socket , implement one side two-way connection Java program another program network . The Socket class sits top platform-dependent implementation , hide detail particular system Java program . By use java.net.Socket class instead rely native code , Java program communicate network platform-independent fashion . Additionally , java.net include ServerSocket class , implement socket server use listen accept connection client . This lesson show use Socket ServerSocket class . If try connect Web , URL class related class ( URLConnection , URLEncoder ) probably appropriate socket class . In fact , URLs relatively high-level connection Web use socket part underlying implementation . See Working URLs information connect Web via URLs .
