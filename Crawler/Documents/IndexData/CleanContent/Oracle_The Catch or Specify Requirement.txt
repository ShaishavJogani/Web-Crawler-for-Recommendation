Valid Java program language code must honor Catch Specify Requirement . This mean code might throw certain exception must enclose either following : A try statement catch exception . The try must provide handler exception , describe Catching Handling Exceptions . A method specify throw exception . The method must provide throw clause list exception , describe Specifying Exceptions Thrown Method . Code fail honor Catch Specify Requirement compile . Not exception subject Catch Specify Requirement . To understand , need look three basic category exception , one subject Requirement . The Three Kinds Exceptions The first kind exception checked exception . These exceptional condition well-written application anticipate recover . For example , suppose application prompt user input file name , open file pass name constructor java.io.FileReader . Normally , user provide name exist , readable file , construction FileReader object succeed , execution application proceeds normally . But sometimes user supply name nonexistent file , constructor throw java.io.FileNotFoundException . A well-written program catch exception notify user mistake , possibly prompt correct file name . Checked exception subject Catch Specify Requirement . All exception checked exception , except indicate Error , RuntimeException , subclass . The second kind exception error . These exceptional condition external application , application usually anticipate recover . For example , suppose application successfully open file input , unable read file hardware system malfunction . The unsuccessful read throw java.io.IOError . An application might choose catch exception , order notify user problem — also might make sense program print stack trace exit . Errors subject Catch Specify Requirement . Errors exception indicate Error subclass . The third kind exception runtime exception . These exceptional condition internal application , application usually anticipate recover . These usually indicate program bug , logic error improper use API . For example , consider application describe previously pass file name constructor FileReader . If logic error cause null pass constructor , constructor throw NullPointerException . The application catch exception , probably make sense eliminate bug cause exception occur . Runtime exception subject Catch Specify Requirement . Runtime exception indicate RuntimeException subclass . Errors runtime exception collectively know unchecked exception . Bypassing Catch Specify Some programmer consider Catch Specify Requirement serious flaw exception mechanism bypass use unchecked exception place checked exception . In general , recommend . The section Unchecked Exceptions — The Controversy talk appropriate use unchecked exception .
