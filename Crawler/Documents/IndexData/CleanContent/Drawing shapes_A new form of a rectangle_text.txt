Figure 9.7 : A pink round rectangle red outline . Amazing ! Simple far , n't ? Of shape , two shape 'd need build moment . Complex graphic routine require build shape like rhombus , triangle , trapezium parallelogram . We would tackle later another section . However , last note I would leave another interesting shape - combination oval rectangle . Think rectangle rounded corner , Rounded Rectangle ( RoundRect ) . Notice syntax thedrawRoundRect ( int , int , int , int , int , int ) method bit different syntax simple rectangle draw routinedrawRect ( int , int , int , int ) . The two new argument add end thewidth arc pixelsand theheight arc pixel . The result pretty amazing run program . You n't need squint eye tell corner rectangle slightly round . The value width height arc , roundness appear form around corner .
