You find link run example how-to page example index . Note : This lesson cover write layout code hand , challenge . If interested learn detail layout management , might prefer use GroupLayout layout manager combine builder tool lay GUI . One builder tool NetBeans IDE . Otherwise , want code hand want use GroupLayout , GridBagLayout recommend next flexible powerful layout manager . If interested use JavaFX create GUI , see Working With Layouts JavaFX . BorderLayout Every content pane initialize use BorderLayout . ( As Using Top-Level Containers explain , content pane main container frame , applet , dialog . ) A BorderLayout place component five area : top , bottom , leave , right , center . All extra space place center area . Tool bar create use JToolBar must create within BorderLayout container , want able drag drop bar away start position . For detail , see How Use BorderLayout .

CardLayout The CardLayout class let implement area contain different component different time .

An alternative use CardLayout use tabbed pane , provide similar functionality pre-defined GUI . For detail , see How Use CardLayout . FlowLayout FlowLayout default layout manager every JPanel . It simply lay component single row , start new row container sufficiently wide . Both panel CardLayoutDemo , show previously , use FlowLayout . For detail , see How Use FlowLayout . GridBagLayout GridBagLayout sophisticated , flexible layout manager . It align component place within grid cell , allow component span one cell . The row grid different height , grid column different width . For detail , see How Use GridBagLayout . GridLayout GridLayout simply make bunch component equal size display requested number row column . For detail , see How Use GridLayout . GroupLayout GroupLayout layout manager develop use GUI builder tool , also use manually . GroupLayout work horizontal vertical layout separately . The layout define dimension independently . Consequently , however , component need define twice layout . The Find window show example GroupLayout . For detail , see How Use GroupLayout . SpringLayout SpringLayout flexible layout manager design use GUI builder . It let specify precise relationship edge component control . For example , might define left edge one component certain distance ( dynamically calculate ) right edge second component . SpringLayout lay child associated container accord set constraint , shall see How Use SpringLayout .
