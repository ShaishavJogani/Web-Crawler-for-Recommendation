Unlike many object-oriented programming language , Java perform automatic garbage collection — unreferenced object automatically erase memory — prohibit user manually destroy object . finalize ( ) [ edit ] When object garbage-collected , programmer may want manually perform cleanup , close open input/output stream . To accomplish , thefinalize ( ) method use . Note thatfinalize ( ) never manually call , except call super class ' finalize method derived class ' finalize method . Also , rely thefinalize ( ) method call . If java application exit object garbage-collected , thefinalize ( ) method may never call . The garbage-collector thread run low priority thread . If application create object faster garbage-collector claim back memory , program run memory . The finalize method require resource beyond direct control Java Virtual Machine need clean . In particular , need explicitly close OutputStream , since OutputStream close get finalize . Instead , finalize method use release either native remote resource control class .
