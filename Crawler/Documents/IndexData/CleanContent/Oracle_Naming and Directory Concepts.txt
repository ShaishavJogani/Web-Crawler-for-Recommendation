Naming Concepts A fundamental facility computing system naming service -- mean name associate object object find base name . When use almost computer program system , always name one object another . For example , use electronic mail system , must provide name recipient . To access file computer , must supply name . A naming service allow look object give name . A naming service 's primary function map people friendly name object , address , identifier , object typically use computer program . For example , Internet Domain Name System ( DNS ) map machine name IP Addresses : www.example.com == > 192.0.2.5 A file system map filename file reference program use access content file . c : \bin\autoexec.bat == > File Reference These two example also illustrate wide range scale name service exist -- name object Internet name file local file system . Names To look object naming system , supply name object . The naming system determine syntax name must follow . This syntax sometimes call name system name convention . A name make component . A name 's representation consist component separator mark component name . Naming System Component Separator Names UNIX file system '' / '' /usr/hello DNS '' . '' sales.Wiz.COM LDAP '' , '' `` = '' cn=Rosanna Lee , o=Sun , c=US The UNIX file system 's naming convention file name path relative root file system , component path separate leave right use forward slash character ( `` / '' ) . The UNIX pathname , /usr/hello , example , name file hello file directory usr , locate root file system . DNS name convention call component DNS name order right leave delimit dot character ( `` . '' ) . Thus DNS name sales.Wiz.COM name DNS entry name sale , relative DNS entry Wiz.COM . The DNS entry Wiz.COM , turn , name entry name Wiz COM entry . The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol ( LDAP ) name convention order component right leave , delimit comma character ( `` , '' ) . Thus LDAP name cn=Rosanna Lee , o=Sun , c=US name LDAP entry cn=Rosanna Lee , relative entry o=Sun , turn , relative c=us . LDAP rule component name must name/value pair name value separate equal character ( `` = '' ) . Bindings The association name object call binding . A file name bind file . The DNS contain binding map machine name IP address . An LDAP name bind LDAP entry . References Addresses Depending naming service , object store directly naming service ; , copy object place inside naming service . Instead , must store reference ; , pointer reference object place inside naming service . A reference represent information access object . Typically , compact representation use communicate object , object might contain state information . Using reference , contact object obtain information object . For example , airplane object might contain list airplane 's passenger crew , flight plan , fuel instrument status , flight number departure time . By contrast , airplane object reference might contain flight number departure time . The reference much compact representation information airplane object use obtain additional information . A file object , example , access use file reference . A printer object , example , might contain state printer , current queue amount paper paper tray . A printer object reference , hand , might contain information reach printer , print server name printing protocol . Although general reference contain arbitrary information , useful refer content address ( communication end point ) : specific information access object . For simplicity , tutorial use `` object '' refer object object reference distinction two require . Context A context set name-to-object binding . Every context associate naming convention . A context always provide lookup ( resolution ) operation return object , typically also provide operation bind name , unbind name , list bound name . A name one context object bind another context object ( call subcontext ) naming convention . A file directory , /usr , UNIX file system represent context . A file directory name relative another file directory represent subcontext ( UNIX user refer subdirectory ) . That , file directory /usr/bin , directory bin subcontext usr . A DNS domain , COM , represent context . A DNS domain name relative another DNS domain represent subcontext . For DNS domain Sun.COM , DNS domain Sun subcontext COM . Finally , LDAP entry , c=us , represent context . An LDAP entry name relative another LDAP entry represent subcontext . For LDAP entry o=sun , c=us , entry o=sun subcontext c=us . Naming Systems Namespaces A naming system connected set context type ( naming convention ) provide common set operation . A system implement DNS naming system . A system communicate use LDAP naming system . A naming system provide naming service customer perform naming-related operation . A naming service access interface . The DNS offer naming service map machine name IP address . LDAP offer naming service map LDAP name LDAP entry . A file system offer naming service map filename file directory . A namespace set possible name naming system . The UNIX file system namespace consisting name file directory file system . The DNS namespace contain name DNS domain entry . The LDAP namespace contain name LDAP entry .
