As focus shift reach GUI client thin client application , Java version 2 , Sun introduce J2EE ( Java 2 Extended Edition ) . J2EE add : Components Base Architecture , ( Servlet , JSP , EJB Containers ) With J2EE following Java component execution possible : Figure 2 : Servlet Execution Java Servlet code ( Figure 2 ) Java get popularity server side programming , specifically withJ2EEservlets . Servlets run simple J2EE framework handle clientHTTPrequests . They mean replaceCGI programmingfor web page render dynamic content.The servlet run calledservlet-container/web container . The servlet 's responsibility : Handle request business logic computation , Connecting database need , Create HTML present user browserThe HTML output represent presention logic result business computation . This represent huge problem , real application rely servlets handle presention part responsibility . There two main solution : Use template tool ( Store presentation part HTML file , mark area need replace business logic computation ) .Use JSP ( See next section ) Wikipedia also article aboutServlets . Figure 3 : Jsp Execution Java Server Pages ( JSP ) code ( Figure 3 ) JSP HTML file embedded Java code inside . The first time JSP access , JSP convert Java Servlet . This servlet output HTML inside result business logic computation . There special JSP tag help add data dynamically HTML . Also JSP technology allow create custom tags.Using JSP technology correctly , business logic computation embedded Java part JSP . JSP use render presentation static dynamic data . Depending complexity data , 100 % separation easy achieve . Using custom tag , however may help get close 100 % . This advocate also inMVCarchitecture ( see ) . Figure 4 : EJB Execution EJB code ( Figure 4 ) In 1990s , client server computing , trend start , move away Mainframe compute . That result many small separate application Company/Enterprise . Many time data use different application . A new philosophy , `` Enterprise Computing '' , create address issue . The idea create component reuse throughout Enterprise . The Enterprise Java Beans ( EJBs ) suppose address this.AnEJBis application component run EJB container . The client access EJB module container , never directly . The container manage life cycle EJB module , handle issue arise network/enterpise computing . Some aresecurity/access control , object pooling , transaction management , ... .EJBs problem reusable code : need generic enough able reuse change maintenance EJBs affect exist client . Many time EJBs use unnecessarily really need . An EJB design separate application enterprise , fulfil one function . Figure 5 : MVC Execution Combine J2EE component create MVC architectureThis lead u three layers/tiers show ( Figure 5 ) .In modern web application , lot static data nice graphic , data present user become important usually need help graphic artist.To help programmer graphic artist work together , separation data , code , present become crucial.Theview ( User Interface Logic ) contain logic necessary construct presentation . This could handle JSP technology.The servlet act thecontrollerand contain logic necessary process user event select appropriate response.The business logic ( model ) actually accomplish goal interaction . This might query update database . This could handle EJB technology.For information MVC , please seeMVC .
