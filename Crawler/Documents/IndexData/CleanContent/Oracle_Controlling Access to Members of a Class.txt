Access level modifier determine whether class use particular field invoke particular method . There two level access control : At top level—public , package-private ( explicit modifier ) . At member level—public , private , protect , package-private ( explicit modifier ) . A class may declare modifier public , case class visible class everywhere . If class modifier ( default , also know package-private ) , visible within package ( package name group related class — learn late lesson . ) At member level , also use public modifier modifier ( package-private ) top-level class , meaning . For member , two additional access modifier : private protect . The private modifier specifies member access class . The protect modifier specifies member access within package ( package-private ) , addition , subclass class another package . The follow table show access member permit modifier . Access Levels Modifier Class Package Subclass World public Y Y Y Y protect Y Y Y N modifier Y Y N N private Y N N N The first data column indicate whether class access member define access level . As see , class always access member . The second column indicate whether class package class ( regardless parentage ) access member . The third column indicate whether subclass class declare outside package access member . The fourth column indicate whether class access member . Access level affect two way . First , use class come another source , class Java platform , access level determine member class class use . Second , write class , need decide access level every member variable every method class . Let 's look collection class see access level affect visibility . The following figure show four class example relate .
