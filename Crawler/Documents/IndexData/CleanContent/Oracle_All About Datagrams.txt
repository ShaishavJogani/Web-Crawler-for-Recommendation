Some application write communicate network require reliable , point-to-point channel provide TCP . Rather , application might benefit mode communication deliver independent package information whose arrival order arrival guarantee . The UDP protocol provide mode network communication whereby application send packet data , call datagrams , one another . A datagram independent , self-contained message send network whose arrival , arrival time , content guarantee . The DatagramPacket DatagramSocket class java.net package implement system-independent datagram communication use UDP . What Is Datagram ? A datagram independent , self-contained message send network whose arrival , arrival time , content guarantee . Writing Datagram Client Server This section walk example contain two Java program use datagrams communicate . The server side quote server listen DatagramSocket send quotation client whenever client request . The client side simple program simply make request server . Broadcasting Multiple Recipients This section modify quote server instead send quotation single client upon request , quote server broadcast quote every minute many client listen . The client program must modify accordingly . Note : Many firewall router configure allow UDP packet . If trouble connect service outside firewall , client trouble connect service , ask system administrator UDP permit .
