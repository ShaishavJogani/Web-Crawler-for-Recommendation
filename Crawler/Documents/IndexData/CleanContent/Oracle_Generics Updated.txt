In nontrivial software project , bug simply fact life . Careful planning , programming , test help reduce pervasiveness , somehow , somewhere , 'll always find way creep code . This become especially apparent new feature introduce code base grow size complexity . Fortunately , bug easy detect others . Compile-time bug , example , detect early ; use compiler 's error message figure problem fix , right . Runtime bug , however , much problematic ; n't always surface immediately , , may point program far remove actual cause problem . Generics add stability code make bug detectable compile time . After complete lesson , may want follow Generics tutorial Gilad Bracha .
