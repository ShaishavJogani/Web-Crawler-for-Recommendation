One significant difference class interface class field whereas interface . In addition , instantiate class create object , interface . As explain section What Is Object ? , object store state field , define class . One reason Java programming language permit extend one class avoid issue multiple inheritance state , ability inherit field multiple class . For example , suppose able define new class extend multiple class . When create object instantiate class , object inherit field class 's superclass . What method constructor different superclass instantiate field ? Which method constructor take precedence ? Because interface contain field , worry problem result multiple inheritance state . Multiple inheritance implementation ability inherit method definition multiple class . Problems arise type multiple inheritance , name conflict ambiguity . When compiler program language support type multiple inheritance encounter superclasses contain method name , sometimes determine member method access invoke . In addition , programmer unwittingly introduce name conflict add new method superclass . Default method introduce one form multiple inheritance implementation . A class implement one interface , contain default method name . The Java compiler provide rule determine default method particular class us . The Java programming language support multiple inheritance type , ability class implement one interface . An object multiple type : type class type interface class implement . This mean variable declare type interface , value reference object instantiate class implement interface . This discuss section Using Interface Type . As multiple inheritance implementation , class inherit different implementation method define ( default static ) interface extend . In case , compiler user must decide one use .
