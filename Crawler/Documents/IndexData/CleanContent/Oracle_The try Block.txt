The first step construct exception handler enclose code might throw exception within try block . In general , try block look like following : try { code } catch finally block . . . The segment example label code contain one legal line code could throw exception . ( The catch finally block explain next two subsection . ) To construct exception handler writeList method ListOfNumbers class , enclose exception-throwing statement writeList method within try block . There one way . You put line code might throw exception within try block provide separate exception handler . Or , put writeList code within single try block associate multiple handler . The following listing use one try block entire method code question short . private List < Integer > list ; private static final int SIZE = 10 ; public void writeList ( ) { PrintWriter = null ; try { System.out.println ( `` Entered try statement '' ) ; = new PrintWriter ( new FileWriter ( `` OutFile.txt '' ) ) ; ( int = 0 ; < SIZE ; i++ ) { out.println ( `` Value : `` + + `` = `` + list.get ( ) ) ; } } catch finally block . . . } If exception occur within try block , exception handle exception handler associate . To associate exception handler try block , must put catch block ; next section , The catch Blocks , show .
