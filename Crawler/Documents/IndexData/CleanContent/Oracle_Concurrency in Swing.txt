Examples Index This lesson discuss concurrency apply Swing programming . It assume already familiar content Concurrency lesson Essential Classes trail . Careful use concurrency particularly important Swing programmer . A well-written Swing program use concurrency create user interface never `` freeze '' â€” program always responsive user interaction , matter 's . To create responsive program , programmer must learn Swing framework employ thread . A Swing programmer deal following kind thread : Initial thread , thread execute initial application code . The event dispatch thread , event-handling code execute . Most code interact Swing framework must also execute thread . Worker thread , also know background thread , time-consuming background task execute . The programmer need provide code explicitly create thread : provide runtime Swing framework . The programmer 's job utilize thread create responsive , maintainable Swing program . Like program run Java platform , Swing program create additional thread thread pool , use tool describe Concurrency lesson . But basic Swing program thread describe sufficient . This lesson discuss three kind thread turn . Worker thread require discussion task run create use javax.swing.SwingWorker . This class many useful feature , include communication coordination worker thread task task thread .
