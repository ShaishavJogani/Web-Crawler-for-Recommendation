The Java Sound API low-level API effect control input output sound medium , include audio Musical Instrument Digital Interface ( MIDI ) data . The Java Sound API provide explicit control capability normally require sound input output , framework promote extensibility flexibility . The Java Sound API fulfill need wide range application developer . Potential application area include : Communication framework , conferencing telephony End-user content delivery system , medium player music use stream content Interactive application program , game Web sit use dynamic content Content creation editing Tools , toolkits , utilities The Java Sound API provide low level sound support Java platform . It provide application program great amount control sound operation , extensible . For example , Java Sound API supply mechanisms installing , access , manipulate system resource audio mixer , MIDI synthesizer , audio MIDI device , file reader writer , sound format converter . The Java Sound API include sophisticated sound editor graphical tool , provide capability upon program build . It emphasize low-level control beyond commonly expect end user . The Java Sound API include support digital audio MIDI data . These two major module functionality provide separate package : javax.sound.sampled – This package specify interface capture , mixing , playback digital ( sample ) audio . javax.sound.midi – This package provide interface MIDI synthesis , sequencing , event transport . Two package permit service provider ( oppose application developer ) create custom software component extend capability implementation Java Sound API : javax.sound.sampled.spi javax.sound.midi.spi This page introduce sampled-audio system , MIDI system , SPI package . Each package discuss great detail later tutorial . Note : There Java platform APIs also sound-related element . The Java Media Framework API ( JMF ) higher-level API currently available Standard Extension Java platform . JMF specify unified architecture , message protocol , program interface capture play back time-based medium . JMF provide simpler solution basic media-player application program , enable synchronization different medium type , audio video . On hand , program focus sound benefit Java Sound API , especially require advanced feature , ability carefully control buffered audio playback directly manipulate MIDI synthesizer . Other Java APIs sound aspect include Java 3D APIs telephony speech . An implementation APIs might use implementation Java Sound API internally , require . What Sampled Audio ? The javax.sound.sampled package handle digital audio data , Java Sound API refers sampled audio . Samples successive snapshot signal . In case audio , signal sound wave . A microphone convert acoustic signal corresponding analog electrical signal , analog-to-digital converter transforms analog signal sampled digital form . The following figure show brief moment sound recording .
