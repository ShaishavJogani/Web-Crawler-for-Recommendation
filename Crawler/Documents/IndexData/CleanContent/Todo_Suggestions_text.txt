Get rid table content ( TOC ) templates.The book need dedicate section . Yoursuggestionsare welcome.I would certainly think good idea add section beginner , intermediate advance.Why ca n't table content index tie together entire book reference , three extra page road-maps `` Begginer '' , `` Intermediate '' `` Advanced '' ? Skill order ( Beginner , Intermediate Advanced ) good idea well follow order implicitly rather explicitly . Cutting book three part n't follow topic make sense . The topic naturally list basic advanced concept.Ftiercel ( discuss•contribs ) 21:49 , 5 November 2012 ( UTC ) I n't see purpose would serve confuse beginner . If book dedicate towards newbie structure way suit . -- Mattylaws ( discuss•contribs ) 13:36 , 19 August 2012 ( UTC ) I suggest add information Grrenfoot program . It slightly easy way newcomer Java learn program game .
