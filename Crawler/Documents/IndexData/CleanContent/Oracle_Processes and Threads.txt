In concurrent programming , two basic unit execution : process thread . In Java programming language , concurrent programming mostly concern thread . However , process also important . A computer system normally many active process thread . This true even system single execution core , thus one thread actually execute give moment . Processing time single core share among process thread OS feature call time slicing . It 's become common computer system multiple processor processor multiple execution core . This greatly enhance system 's capacity concurrent execution process thread — concurrency possible even simple system , without multiple processor execution core . Processes A process self-contained execution environment . A process generally complete , private set basic run-time resource ; particular , process memory space . Processes often see synonymous program application . However , user see single application may fact set cooperate process . To facilitate communication process , operate system support Inter Process Communication ( IPC ) resource , pipe socket . IPC use communication process system , process different system . Most implementation Java virtual machine run single process . A Java application create additional process use ProcessBuilder object . Multiprocess application beyond scope lesson . Threads Threads sometimes call lightweight process . Both process thread provide execution environment , create new thread require resource create new process . Threads exist within process — every process least one . Threads share process 's resource , include memory open file . This make efficient , potentially problematic , communication . Multithreaded execution essential feature Java platform . Every application least one thread — several , count `` system '' thread thing like memory management signal handling . But application programmer 's point view , start one thread , call main thread . This thread ability create additional thread , 'll demonstrate next section .
