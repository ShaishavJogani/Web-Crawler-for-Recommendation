For example , invoke myColorChooser.setDragEnabled ( true ) drag color color chooser : JColorChooser JEditorPane JFileChooser JFormattedTextField JList JTable JTextArea JTextField JTextPane JTree The following component support drop box . If use one component , work . JEditorPane JFormattedTextField JPasswordField JTextArea JTextField JTextPane JColorChooser The framework drop place following component , need plug small amount code customize support need . JList JTable JTree For critical component , Swing performs drop location calculation render ; allow specify drop mode ; handle component specific detail , tree expansion . Your work fairly minimal .
