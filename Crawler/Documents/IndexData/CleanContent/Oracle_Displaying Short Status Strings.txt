All browser allow Java applet display short status string . All Java applet page , well browser , share status line . Never put crucial information status line . If many user might need information , display information within applet area . If , sophisticated user might need information , consider send information standard output ( see Writing Diagnostics Standard Output Error Streams ) . The status line usually prominent , overwrite applet browser . For reason , best use incidental , transitory information . For example , applet load several image file might display name image file currently load . Applets display status line showStatus method , inherit JApplet class Applet class . Here example use : showStatus ( `` MyApplet : Loading image file `` + file ) ; Note : Do n't put scroll text status line . Browser user find behavior highly annoy .
