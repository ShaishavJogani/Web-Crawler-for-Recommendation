The JDBC API support two-tier three-tier processing model database access . Figure 1 : Two-tier Architecture Data Access . In two-tier model , Java application talk directly data source . This require JDBC driver communicate particular data source access . A user 's command deliver database data source , result statement send back user . The data source may locate another machine user connect via network . This refer client/server configuration , user 's machine client , machine housing data source server . The network intranet , , example , connect employee within corporation , Internet . In three-tier model , command send `` middle tier '' service , send command data source . The data source process command send result back middle tier , send user . MIS director find three-tier model attractive middle tier make possible maintain control access kind update make corporate data . Another advantage simplify deployment application . Finally , many case , three-tier architecture provide performance advantage . Figure 2 : Three-tier Architecture Data Access . Until recently , middle tier often write language C C++ , offer fast performance . However , introduction optimize compiler translate Java bytecode efficient machine-specific code technology Enterprise JavaBeansâ„¢ , Java platform fast become standard platform middle-tier development . This big plus , make possible take advantage Java 's robustness , multithreading , security feature . With enterprise increasingly use Java programming language write server code , JDBC API use middle tier three-tier architecture . Some feature make JDBC server technology support connection pooling , distribute transaction , disconnect rowsets . The JDBC API also allow access data source Java middle tier .
