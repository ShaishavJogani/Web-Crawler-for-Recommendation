Unlike C C++ , Java 's growth pretty recent . Here , 'd quickly go development path Java take age . Development Java year . From version 1.0 version 1.7 , Java display steady growth . Initial Release ( version 1.0 1.1 ) [ edit ] Introduced 1996 theSolaris , Windows , Mac OSClassic andLinux , Java initially release Java Development Kit 1.0 ( JDK 1.0 ) . This include Java runtime ( virtual machine class library ) , development tool ( e.g. , Java compiler ) . Later , Sun also provide runtime-only package , call Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) . The first name stuck , however , usually people refer particular version Java JDK version ( e.g. , JDK 1.0 ) . Java 2 ( version 1.2 ) [ edit ] Introduced 1998 quick fix former version , version 1.2 start new beginning Java . The JDKs version 1.2 late version often calledJava 2as well . For example , official name JDK 1.4 isThe Java ( TM ) 2 Platform , Standard Edition version 1.4 . Major change include : Rewrite event handling ( addEvent Listeners ) Change Thread synchronizationsIntroduction JIT-Just time compiler Kestrel ( Java 1.3 ) [ edit ] Released 8 May 2000 . The notable change : HotSpot JVM include ( HotSpot JVM first release April , 1999 J2SE 1.2 JVM ) RMI modify support optional compatibility CORBAJavaSoundJava Naming Directory Interface ( JNDI ) include core library ( previously available extension ) Java Platform Debugger Architecture ( JPDA ) Synthetic proxy class Merlin ( Java 1.4 ) [ edit ] Released 6 February 2002 , Java 1.4 improve programmer productivity expand language feature available APIs : AssertionRegular ExpressionXML processingCryptography Secure Socket Layer ( SSL ) Non-blocking I/O ( NIO ) Logging Tiger ( version 1.5.0 ; Java SE 5 ) [ edit ] Released September 2004 Major change include : Generics- Provides compile-time type safety collection : eliminate drudgery casting.Autoboxing/unboxing- Eliminates drudgery manual conversion primitive type ( int ) wrapper type ( Integer ) .Enhanced - Shorten loop Collections use.Static import - Lets import static part class.Annotation/Metadata - Enabling tool generate code deployment descriptor annotation source code . This lead `` declarative '' programming style programmer say tool emit code . Annotations inspect source parsing use additional reflection APIs add Java 5.JVM Improvements - Most run time library map memory memory image , oppose load series class file . Large portion runtime library share among multiple JVM instance . Mustang ( version 1.6.0 ; Java SE 6 ) [ edit ] Released 11 December 2006 . What 's New Java SE 6 : Web Services - First-class support write XML web service client application . Scripting - You mix JavaScript technology source code , useful prototyping . Also useful team variety skill set . More advanced developer plug scripting engine mix favorite scripting language Java code see fit . Database - No need find configure JDBC database develop database application . Developers also get updated JDBC 4.0 , well-used API many important improvement , special support XML SQL datatype good integration Binary Large OBjects ( BLOBs ) Character Large OBjects ( CLOBs ) APIs . More Desktop APIs - GUI developer get large number new trick play like ever popular yet newly incorporate SwingWorker utility help thread GUI apps , JTable sorting filtering , new facility quick splash screen quiet impatient user . Monitoring Management - The really big deal n't need anything special startup able attach demand monitoring management tool Java SE platform . Compiler Access - Really aim people create tool Java development framework like JavaServer Pages ( JSP ) Personal Home Page construction kit ( PHP ) engines need generate bunch class demand , compiler API open programmatic access javac in-process compilation dynamically generate Java code . The compiler API directly intend everyday developer , deafen scream inner geek , roll sleeve give try . And rest u happily benefit tool improved Java framework use . Pluggable Annotations allow programmer write annotation processor analyse code semantically javac compiles . For example , could write annotation processor verify whether program obeys name convention . Desktop Deployment - At long last , Java SE 6 unify Java Plug-in technology Java WebStart engine , make sense . Installation Java WebStart application get much need makeover . Security - Java SE 6 simplify job security administrator provide various new way access platform-native security service , native Public Key Infrastructure ( PKI ) cryptographic service Microsoft Windows secure authentication communication , Java Generic Security Services ( Java GSS ) Kerberos service authentication , access LDAP server authenticate user . The -lities : Quality , Compatibility , Stability - Bug fix ... Dolphin ( version 1.7.0 ; Java SE 7 ) [ edit ] Released 28 July 2011 . Feature addition Java 7 include : JVM support dynamic language , follow prototyping work currently Multi Language Virtual MachineCompressed 64-bit pointer Available Java 6 with-XX : +UseCompressedOopsSmall language change ( group project name Coin ) : Strings switchAutomatic resource management try-statementImproved type inference generic instance creationSimplified varargs method declarationBinary integer literalsAllowing underscore numeric literalsCatching multiple exception type rethrowing exception improved type check Concurrency utility JSR 166New file I/O library enhance platform independence add support metadata symbolic link . The new package java.nio.file java.nio.file.attributeLibrary-level support Elliptic curve cryptography algorithmsAn XRender pipeline Java 2D , improve handling feature specific modern GPUsNew platform APIs graphic feature originally plan release Java version 6u10Enhanced library-level support new network protocol , include SCTP Sockets Direct ProtocolUpstream update XML Unicode Lambda ( Java 's implementation lambda function ) , Jigsaw ( Java 's implementation module ) , part Coin drop Java 7 . Spider ( version 1.8.0 ; Java SE 8 ) [ edit ] Java 8 release 18 March 2014 , include feature plan Java 7 later defer . Work feature organize term JDK Enhancement Proposals ( JEPs ) . JSR 335 , JEP 126 : Language-level support lambda expression ( officially , lambda expression ; unofficially , closure ) Project Lambda allow addition method interface without break exist implementation . There ongoing debate Java community whether add support lambda expression . Supporting lambda expression also allow performance functional-style operation stream element , MapReduce-inspired transformation collection . Default method allow author API add new method interface without break old code use . Although primary intent , default method also allow multiple inheritance behavior ( state ) . JSR 223 , JEP 174 : Project Nashorn , JavaScript runtime allow developer embed JavaScript code within applicationsJSR 308 , JEP 104 : Annotation Java TypesUnsigned Integer ArithmeticJSR 337 , JEP 120 : Repeating annotationsJSR 310 , JEP 150 : Date Time APIJEP 178 : Statically-linked JNI librariesJEP 153 : Launch JavaFX application ( direct launching JavaFX application JARs ) JEP 122 : Remove permanent generation
