Java rich internet application ( RIA ) application trait similar desktop application , deploy via Internet . Java RIAs may develop deploy Java applets Java Web Start application . Applets - Java applet run context browser . The Java Plug-in software control execution lifecycle Java applet . Java Web Start application - Java Web Start application launch via browser first time . They may subsequently launch desktop shortcut . Once Java Web Start application download security certificate accept user , behave almost like standalone application . Component-Based Architecture RIAs In past , decision whether deploy Java rich internet application inside browser applet , outside browser Java Web Start application , could significantly impact design application . With late Java Plug-in , decision greatly simplify . Traditionally , application construct user interface , include top-level Frame , main method . This programming style prevents easy re-deployment application browser , assume application create Frame . When run browser applet , applet top level container hold user interface application . A top-level Frame need . Use component-based architecture design Java rich internet application . Try organize functionality one component compose together . In context , term `` component '' refers GUI element subclass AWT Component class , Swing JComponent class , another subclass . For example , could top level JPanel contain UI component ( like combination nested JPanels text field , combo box etc. ) . With design , become relatively easy deploy core functionality applet Java Web Start application . To deploy Java applet , need wrap core functionality Applet JApplet add browser specific functionality , necessary . To deploy Java Web Start application , wrap functionality JFrame . Choosing Between Java Applets Java Web Start Applications The Rich Internet Applications Decision Guide contain detailed information help decide whether deploy code Java applet Java Web Start application . The Self-Contained Application Alternative Self-contained application provide deployment option require browser . Users install application locally run similar native application . Self-contained application include JRE need run application , users always correct JRE . This trail discuss development deployment RIAs self-contained application . See What 's New capability introduce various version client Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) software .
