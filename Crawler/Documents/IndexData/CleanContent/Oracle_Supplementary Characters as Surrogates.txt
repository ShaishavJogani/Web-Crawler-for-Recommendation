To support supplementary character without change char primitive data type cause incompatibility previous Java program , supplementary character define pair code point value call surrogate . The first code point high surrogate range U+D800 U+DBFF , second code point low surrogate range U+DC00 U+DFFF . For example , Deseret character LONG I , U+10400 , define pair surrogate value : U+D801 U+DC00 .
