SDP support essentially TCP bypass technology . When SDP enable application attempt open TCP connection , TCP mechanism bypass communication go directly IB network . For example , application attempt bind TCP address , underlie software decide , base information configuration file , rebound SDP protocol . This process happen binding process connecting process ( happen socket ) . There API change require code take advantage SDP protocol : implementation transparent support classic networking ( java.net ) New I/O ( java.nio.channels ) package . See Supported Java APIs section list class support SDP protocol . SDP support disable default . The step enable SDP support : Create SDP configuration file . Set system property specify location configuration file .
