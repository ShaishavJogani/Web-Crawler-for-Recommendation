Syntax : [ public|protected|private ] nativemethod ( ) ; Native method use past write performance critical section java get faster less common . Native method currently need You need call java library , write another language.You need access system hardware resource reachable language ( typicallyC ) . Actually , many system function interact real computer ( disk network IO , instance ) call native code . To complete write native method , need process class withjavahtool generate header code C. You need provide implementation header code , produce dynamically loadable library ( .sounder Linux , .dllunder Windows ) load ( simple case withSystem.load ( library_file_name ) . The code completion trivial primitive type like integer pass get complex need exchange string object C code . In general , everything C level , include creation new object call back method , write java . To call code language ( includingC++ ) , need write bridge C language . This usually trivial language callable C .
