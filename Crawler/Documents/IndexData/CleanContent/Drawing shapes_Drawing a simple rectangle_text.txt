We proceed second drawing . A simple rectangle would justice , see code . In example , see easy draw simple rectangle use thedrawRect ( int , int , int , int ) method theGraphicsinstance obtain . Run program see simple black outline rectangle appear blank canvas . The four argument pass method , order appearance , thex-coordinate , they-coordinate , widthand theheight . Hence , resultant rectangle would start painting point screen 10 pixel left 10 top would 100 pixel wide 100 pixel height . To save argument , drawing square equal side square draw use method method asdrawSquare ( int , int , int ) Figure 9.4 : Same rectangle draw red outline Playing around color [ edit ] You change color outline tell theGraphicsinstance color desire . This follow : Running program would render rectangle red colored outline . For purpose bring color drawing , use method namely thesetColor ( Color ) method . This method come force draw make call another color set . It ask argument typeColor . Now idea actually instantiate aColorclass , class built-in color . Some built-in color use mention . Color.redColor.blueColor.greenColor.yellowColor.pinkColor.blackColor.white Try run program cod change color different colored outline time . Play around bit color . Look Color class API documentation theexternal linksat bottom page . Figure 9.5 : Same rectangle draw red outline yellow fill Filling area rectangle [ edit ] Up , able draw simple rectangle ask question silently , `` outline rectangle paint rather area whole ? '' The answer simple . Any method start withdrawXxxx ( ... ) draw outline . To paint area within outline , use thefillXxxx ( ... ) method . For instance , code would fill rectangle yellow color red outline . Notice argument remain . Figure 9.6 : A white circle drawn blue outline
