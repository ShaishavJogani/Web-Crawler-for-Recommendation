You optionally seal package extension JAR file additional security measure . If package seal , class define package must originate single JAR file . Without seal , `` hostile '' program could create class define member one extension package . The hostile software would free access package-protected member extension package . Sealing package extension different seal JAR-packaged class . To seal extension package , must add Sealed header manifest JAR file contain extension . You seal individual package associate Sealed header package ' Name header . A Sealed header associate individual package archive signal package seal . Such `` global '' Sealed header override Sealed header associate individual package . The value associate Sealed header either true false . Examples Let 's look sample manifest file . For example suppose JAR file contain package : com/myCompany/package_1/ com/myCompany/package_2/ com/myCompany/package_3/ com/myCompany/package_4/ Suppose want seal package . You could simply add archive-level Sealed header manifest like : Manifest-Version : 1.0 Sealed : true All package JAR file manifest seal . If want seal com.myCompany.package_3 , could manifest : Manifest-Version : 1.0 Name : com/myCompany/package_3/ Sealed : true In example Sealed header associate Name header package com.myCompany.package_3 , package seal . ( The Sealed header associate Name header blank line . ) For final example , suppose want seal package except com.myCompany.package_2 . You could accomplish manifest like : Manifest-Version : 1.0 Sealed : true Name : com/myCompany/package_2/ Sealed : false In example archive-level Sealed : true header indicate package JAR file seal . However , manifest also Sealed : false header associate package com.myCompany.package_2 , header override archive-level sealing package . Therefore manifest cause package seal except com.myCompany.package_2 .
