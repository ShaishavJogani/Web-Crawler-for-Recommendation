The JRE take care run Java code multiple platform , however developer , interested write pure code Java convert Java byte-code mass deployment . As developer , donotneed write Java byte-code ; rather write code Java programming language ( quite similar write C C++ code ) . Upon download JDK , developer ensure system appropriate JRE additional tool help development application Java programming language . Java code find file extension.java . These file calledJava source file . In order convert Java code source file Java byte-code , need use theJava compilertool instal JDK . The Java compiler [ edit ] TheJava compilertool ( namedjavacin JDK ) important utility find JDK . In order compile Java source file ( say , SomeApplication.java ) respective Java byte-code , would need use following command Command Prompt ( Windows ) Terminal ( Linux Mac OS ) : Compilationjavac SomeApplication.java This command would convert theSomeApplication.javasource file equivalent Java byte-code . The resultant byte-code would exist newly create file namedSomeApplication.class . This process convert Java source file equivalent byte-codes know ascompilation . Figure 4 : The basic Java compilation process A list JDK toolsThere huge array tool available JDK explain due time progress book . These tool briefly list order usage : Applet development [ edit ] appletviewer— Java applets require particular environment execute . Typically , environment provide browser Java plug-in , web server serve applet . However , development testing applet might convenient start applet without need fiddle browser web server . In case , Oracle 's appletviewer JDK use run applet.Annotation processing [ edit ] For annotation processing , read thisIn Java 1.5 ( alias Java 5.0 ) Oracle add mechanism calledannotations . Annotations allow addition meta-data Java source code , even provide mechanism carry meta-data compiled.classfiles.apt— An annotation processing tool dig source code , find annotation statement source code execute action find known annotation . The common task generate particular source code . The action apt performs find annotation source code hard-coded apt . Instead , one code particular annotation handler ( Java ) . These handler call annotation processor . It also describe simple way without Oracle terminology : apt see source code preprocessor framework , annotation processor typically code generators.Integration non-Java Java code [ edit ] javah— A Java class call native , non-Java , code prepare call Java . The detail procedure specify JNI ( Java Native Interface ) . Commonly , native code write C ( C++ ) . The JDK tool javah help write necessary C code , generate C header file C stub code.Class library conflict [ edit ] extcheck— It use prior installation Java extension JDK JRE environment . It check particular Jar file conflict already installed extension . This tool appear first Java 1.5.Software security cryptography tool [ edit ] The JDK come large number tool relate security feature Java . Usage tool first require study particular security mechanism . The tool : keytool— To manage key certificatesjarsigner— To generate verify digital signature JARs ( Java ARchives ) policytool— To edit policy fileskinit— To obtain Kerberos v5 ticketsklist— To manage Kerberos credential cache key tablektab— To manage entry key tableThe Java archiver [ edit ] jar— ( short Java archiver ) tool create Java archive jar file — file with.jaras extension . A Java archive collection compile Java class resource class may require ( text file , configuration file , image ) runtime . Internally , jar file really a.zip file.The Java debugger [ edit ] jdb— ( short Java debugger ) command-line console provide adebuggingenvironment Java program . Although use command line console , IDE 's normally provide easy use debug environments.Documenting code Java [ edit ] As program grow large complex , programmer need way track change understand code well step evolution . For decade , programmer employ use special programming construct call comment — region help declare user definition code snippet within source code . But comment prone verbose incomprehensible , let alone difficult read application hundred line code.javadoc— Java provide user way easily publish documentation code use special commenting system javadoc tool . The javadoc tool generate documentation Application Programming Interface ( API ) set user-created Java class . javadoc read source file comment the.javasource file generates HTML document easy read understand without look code itself.javap— Where Javadoc provide detailed view API documentation Java class , javap tool print information regard member ( constructor , method variable ) class . In word , list class ' API and/or compiled instruction class . javap formatting disassembler Java bytecode.The native2ascii tool [ edit ] native2asciiis important , though underappreciated , tool write property file — file contain configuration data — resource bundle — file contain language translation text.Such file contain ASCII Latin-1 character , international programmer need full range character set . Text use character appear property file resource bundle non-ASCII non-Latin-^1 character convert intoUnicode escape sequence ( \uXXXX notation ) .The task write escape sequence handle bynative2ascii . You write international text editor use appropriate character encoding , usenative2asciito generate necessary ASCII text embedded Unicode escape sequence . Despite name , native2asciican also convert ASCII native , useful convert exist property file resource bundle back encoding.native2asciimakes sense integrate build system automate conversion.Remote Method Invocation ( RMI ) tool [ edit ] To : Add sectionJava IDL RMI-IIOP Tools [ edit ] To : Add sectionDeployment & Web Start Tools [ edit ] To : Add sectionBrowser Plug-In Tools [ edit ] To : Add sectionMonitoring Management Tools / Troubleshooting Tools [ edit ] With Java 1.5 set monitoring management tool add JDK , addition set troubleshoot tools.The monitoring management tool intend monitoring manage virtual machine execution environment . They allow , example , monitor memory usage execution Java program.The troubleshooting tool provide rather esoteric insight aspect virtual machine . ( Interestingly , Java debugger categorize troubleshoot tool . ) All monitoring management troubleshooting tool currently mark `` experimental '' ( affect jdb ) . So might disappear future JDKs . Java class library ( JCL ) [ edit ] In modern operate system , large body reusable code provide simplify programmer 's job . This code typically provide set ofdynamically loadable librariesthat application call runtime . Because Java platform dependent specific operating system , application rely exist library . Instead , Java platform provide comprehensive set standard class library , contain much reusable function commonly find modern operate system . The Java class library serve three purpose within Java platform . Like standard code library , provide programmer well-known set function perform common task , maintain list item perform complex string parsing . In addition , class libraries provide abstract interface task would normally depend heavily hardware operating system . Tasks network access file access often heavily dependent native capability platform . The Java java.net java.io library implement required native code internally , provide standard interface Java application perform task . Finally , underlying platform may support feature Java application expect . In case , class libraries either emulate feature use whatever available , provide consistent way check presence specific feature .
