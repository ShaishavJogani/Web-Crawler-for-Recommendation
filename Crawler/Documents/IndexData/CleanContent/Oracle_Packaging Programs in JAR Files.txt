The Javaâ„¢ Archive ( JAR ) file format enable bundle multiple file single archive file . Typically JAR file contain class file auxiliary resource associate applet application . The JAR file format provide many benefit : Security : You digitally sign content JAR file . Users recognize signature optionally grant software security privilege would n't otherwise . Decreased download time : If applet bundle JAR file , applet 's class file associated resource download browser single HTTP transaction without need open new connection file . Compression : The JAR format allow compress file efficient storage . Packaging extension : The extension framework provide mean add functionality Java core platform , JAR file format define packaging extension . By use JAR file format , turn software extension well . Package Sealing : Packages store JAR file optionally seal package enforce version consistency . Sealing package within JAR file mean class define package must find JAR file . Package Versioning : A JAR file hold data file contain , vendor version information . Portability : The mechanism handle JAR file standard part Java platform 's core API .
