The following quick reference summarize operator support Java programming language . Simple Assignment Operator = Simple assignment operator Arithmetic Operators + Additive operator ( also use String concatenation ) - Subtraction operator * Multiplication operator / Division operator % Remainder operator Unary Operators + Unary plus operator ; indicate positive value ( number positive without , however ) - Unary minus operator ; negate expression ++ Increment operator ; increments value 1 -- Decrement operator ; decrements value 1 ! Logical complement operator ; invert value boolean Equality Relational Operators == Equal ! = Not equal > Greater > = Greater equal < Less < = Less equal Conditional Operators & & Conditional-AND || Conditional-OR ? : Ternary ( shorthand if-then-else statement ) Type Comparison Operator instanceof Compares object specify type Bitwise Bit Shift Operators ~ Unary bitwise complement < < Signed leave shift > > Signed right shift > > > Unsigned right shift & Bitwise AND ^ Bitwise exclusive OR | Bitwise inclusive OR
