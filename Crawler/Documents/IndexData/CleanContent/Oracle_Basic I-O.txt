This lesson cover Java platform class use basic I/O . It first focus I/O Streams , powerful concept greatly simplify I/O operation . The lesson also look serialization , let program write whole object stream read back . Then lesson look file I/O file system operation , include random access file . Most class cover I/O Streams section java.io package . Most class cover File I/O section java.nio.file package . I/O Streams Byte Streams handle I/O raw binary data . Character Streams handle I/O character data , automatically handle translation local character set . Buffered Streams optimize input output reduce number call native API . Scanning Formatting allow program read write format text . I/O Command Line describe Standard Streams Console object . Data Streams handle binary I/O primitive data type String value . Object Streams handle binary I/O object . File I/O ( Featuring NIO.2 ) What Path ? examines concept path file system . The Path Class introduce cornerstone class java.nio.file package . Path Operations look method Path class deal syntactic operation . File Operations introduces concept common many file I/O method . Checking File Directory show check file 's existence level accessibility . Deleting File Directory . Copying File Directory . Moving File Directory . Managing Metadata explain read set file attribute . Reading , Writing Creating Files show stream channel method reading write file . Random Access Files show read write file non-sequentially manner . Creating Reading Directories cover API specific directory , list directory 's content . Links , Symbolic Otherwise cover issue specific symbolic hard link . Walking File Tree demonstrate recursively visit file directory file tree . Finding Files show search file use pattern matching . Watching Directory Changes show use watch service detect file add , remove update one directory . Other Useful Methods cover important API n't fit elsewhere lesson . Legacy File I/O Code show leverage Path functionality old code use java.io.File class . A table mapping java.io.File API java.nio.file API provide . Summary A summary key point cover trail . Questions Exercises Test 've learn trail try question exercise . The I/O Classes Action Many example next trail , Custom Networking use I/O stream describe lesson read write network connection . Security consideration : Some I/O operation subject approval current security manager . The example program contain lesson standalone application , default security manager . To work applet , example would modify . See What Applets Can Can Do information security restriction place applet .
