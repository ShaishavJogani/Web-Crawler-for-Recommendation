An anonymous class define instantiate context reference use , nested class exist class . Anonymous class special case class local method ; hence also access final local variable enclose method . Anonymous class useful create instance interface adapter class without need brand new class . In example class implement theActionListenerisanonymous . The class define instantiate . The code hard read class explicitly define , use ? If many implementation need interface , class use one particular place , would hard come name , use ananonymousinner class make sense . The following example use anonymous inner class implement action listener . The following example thing , name class implement action listener .
