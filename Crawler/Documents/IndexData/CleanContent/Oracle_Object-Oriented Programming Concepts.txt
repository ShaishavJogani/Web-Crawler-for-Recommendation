If 've never use object-oriented programming language , 'll need learn basic concept begin write code . This lesson introduce object , class , inheritance , interface , package . Each discussion focus concept relate real world , simultaneously provide introduction syntax Java programming language . What Is Object ? An object software bundle related state behavior . Software object often use model real-world object find everyday life . This lesson explain state behavior represent within object , introduce concept data encapsulation , explain benefit design software manner . What Is Class ? A class blueprint prototype object create . This section define class model state behavior real-world object . It intentionally focus basic , show even simple class cleanly model state behavior . What Is Inheritance ? Inheritance provide powerful natural mechanism organize structure software . This section explain class inherit state behavior superclass , explain derive one class another use simple syntax provide Java programming language . What Is Interface ? An interface contract class outside world . When class implement interface , promise provide behavior publish interface . This section define simple interface explain necessary change class implement . What Is Package ? A package namespace organize class interface logical manner . Placing code package make large software project easy manage . This section explain useful , introduces Application Programming Interface ( API ) provide Java platform . Questions Exercises : Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Use question exercise present section test understanding object , class , inheritance , interface , package .
