An abstract class class declare abstractâ€”it may may include abstract method . Abstract class instantiate , subclassed . An abstract method method declare without implementation ( without brace , follow semicolon ) , like : abstract void moveTo ( double deltaX , double deltaY ) ; If class include abstract method , class must declare abstract , : public abstract class GraphicObject { // declare field // declare nonabstract method abstract void draw ( ) ; } When abstract class subclassed , subclass usually provide implementation abstract method parent class . However , , subclass must also declare abstract . Note : Methods interface ( see Interfaces section ) declare default static implicitly abstract , abstract modifier use interface method . ( It use , unnecessary . ) Abstract Classes Compared Interfaces Abstract class similar interface . You instantiate , may contain mix method declare without implementation . However , abstract class , declare field static final , define public , protect , private concrete method . With interface , field automatically public , static , final , method declare define ( default method ) public . In addition , extend one class , whether abstract , whereas implement number interface . Which use , abstract class interface ? Consider use abstract class statement apply situation : You want share code among several closely related class . You expect class extend abstract class many common method field , require access modifier public ( protected private ) . You want declare non-static non-final field . This enable define method access modify state object belong . Consider use interface statement apply situation : You expect unrelated class would implement interface . For example , interface Comparable Cloneable implement many unrelated class . You want specify behavior particular data type , concern implement behavior . You want take advantage multiple inheritance type . An example abstract class JDK AbstractMap , part Collections Framework . Its subclass ( include HashMap , TreeMap , ConcurrentHashMap ) share many method ( include get , put , isEmpty , containsKey , containsValue ) AbstractMap define . An example class JDK implement several interface HashMap , implement interface Serializable , Cloneable , Map < K , V > . By read list interface , infer instance HashMap ( regardless developer company implement class ) clone , serializable ( mean convert byte stream ; see section Serializable Objects ) , functionality map . In addition , Map < K , V > interface enhance many default method merge forEach old class implement interface define . Note many software library use abstract class interface ; HashMap class implement several interface also extend abstract class AbstractMap . An Abstract Class Example In object-oriented drawing application , draw circle , rectangle , line , Bezier curve , many graphic object . These object certain state ( example : position , orientation , line color , fill color ) behavior ( example : moveTo , rotate , resize , draw ) common . Some state behavior graphic object ( example : position , fill color , moveTo ) . Others require different implementation ( example , resize draw ) . All GraphicObjects must able draw resize ; differ . This perfect situation abstract superclass . You take advantage similarity declare graphic object inherit abstract parent object ( example , GraphicObject ) show following figure .
