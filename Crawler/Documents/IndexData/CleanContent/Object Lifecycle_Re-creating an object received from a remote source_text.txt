When object send network , object need bere-createdat receiving host . Object SerializationThe termObject Serializationrefers act convert object byte stream . The byte stream store file system send network.At late time object re-created stream byte . The requirement class available time , object serialize also object re-created . If happen different server , class must available server . Same class mean exactly version class must available , otherwise object wo n't able re-created . This maintenance problem application java serialization use make object persistent send object network.When class modify , could problem re-creating object serialize use early version class . Java built-in support serialization , use theSerializableinterface ; however , class must first implement theSerializableinterface . By default , class field serialize convert data stream ( withtransientfields skip ) . If additional handling require beyond default write field , need provide implementation following three method : private void writeObject ( java.io.ObjectOutputStream ) throw IOException ; private void readObject ( java.io.ObjectInputStream ) throw IOException , ClassNotFoundException ; private void readObjectNoData ( ) throw ObjectStreamException ; If object need write provide replacement object serialization , need implement following two method , access specifier : Object writeReplace ( ) throw ObjectStreamException ; Object readResolve ( ) throw ObjectStreamException ; Normally , minor change class cause serialization fail . You still allow class load define serialization version id :
