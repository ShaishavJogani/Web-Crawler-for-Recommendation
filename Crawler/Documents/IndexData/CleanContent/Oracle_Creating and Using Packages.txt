To make type easy find use , avoid naming conflict , control access , programmer bundle group related type package . Definition : A package grouping related type provide access protection name space management . Note type refers class , interface , enumeration , annotation type . Enumerations annotation type special kind class interface , respectively , type often refer lesson simply class interface . The type part Java platform member various package bundle class function : fundamental class java.lang , class reading writing ( input output ) java.io , . You put type package . Suppose write group class represent graphic object , circle , rectangle , line , point . You also write interface , Draggable , class implement drag mouse . //in Draggable.java file public interface Draggable { ... } //in Graphic.java file public abstract class Graphic { ... } //in Circle.java file public class Circle extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } //in Rectangle.java file public class Rectangle extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } //in Point.java file public class Point extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } //in Line.java file public class Line extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } You bundle class interface package several reason , include following : You programmer easily determine type relate . You programmer know find type provide graphics-related function . The name type wo n't conflict type name package package create new namespace . You allow type within package unrestricted access one another yet still restrict access type outside package .
