Any piece code write Java programming language run operating system , platform architecture — fact , run device support Java platform . Before Java , amount ubiquity hard achieve . If software write Unix-based system , impossible run application Windows system — case , application native Unix-based system . A major milestone development Java programming language develop special runtime environment would execute Java applicationindependentof computer 's operating system , platform architecture . TheJava Runtime Environment ( JRE ) sit top machine 's operating system , platform architecture . If Java application run , JRE act liaison underlie platform application . It interpret Java application run accordance underlie platform , upon run application , look behave like native application . The part JRE accomplish complex liaison agreement call theJava Virtual Machine ( JVM ) . Figure 1 : Java application bewritten onceandrun anywhere . This feature Java platformis commonly abbreviate toWORAin formal Java text . Executing native Java code ( orbyte-code ) [ edit ] Native Java application preserve special format call thebyte-code . Byte-code remain , matter hardware architecture , operate system , software platform run . On file-system , Java byte-code resides file the.class ( also know aclass file ) the.jar ( also know aJava archive ) extension . To run byte-code , JRE come special tool ( appropriately namedjava ) . Suppose byte-code calledSomeApplication.class . If want execute Java byte-code , would need use following command Command Prompt ( Windows ) Terminal ( Linux Mac OS ) : Execution $ java SomeApplication If want execute Java byte-code a.jarextension ( say , SomeApplication.jar ) , would need use following command Command Prompt ( Windows ) Terminal ( Linux Mac OS ) : Execution jar $ java -jar SomeApplication.jar Not Java class file Java archive executable . Therefore , thejavatool would able execute file executable . Non-executable class file Java archive simply calledclass library . Do JRE ? [ edit ] Most computer come pre-installed copy JRE . If computer n't JRE , command would work . You always check version JRE instal computer write following command Command Prompt ( Windows ) Terminal ( Linux Mac OS ) : Java version $ java -version Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) [ edit ] Quite possibly , important part JRE theJava Virtual Machine ( JVM ) . The JVM act like avirtualprocessor , enable Java application run local system . Its main purpose interpret ( readtranslate ) receive byte-code make appear native code . The old Java architecture use process ofinterpretationto execute Java byte-code . Even though process interpretation bring WORA principle diverse machine , drawback — consume lot time clock system processor intensively load application . Figure 2 : A JVM interpretertranslatesthe byte-code line-by-line make appear native application execute . Just-in-Time Compilation [ edit ] Since version 1.2 , JRE feature robust JVM . Instead interpret byte-code , down-right convert code straight equivalent native code local system . This process conversion calledjust-in-time compilationorJIT-compilation . This process occur byte-code execute first time . Unless byte-code change , JVM use compiled version byte-code every successive execution . Doing save lot time processor effort , allow application execute much fast cost asmalldelay first execution . Figure 3 : A just-in-time compiler compile byte-code equivalent native code first execution . Upon every successiveexecution , JVM merely use alreadycompilednative code optimize performance . Native optimization [ edit ] The JVM intelligentvirtualprocessor . It ability identify area within Java code optimize faster good performance . Based every successive run Java application , JVM would optimize run even well . There portion Java code require JIT-compiled runtime , e.g. , theReflection API ; therefore , code use function necessarily fully compile native code . Was JVM firstvirtual machine ? [ edit ] Java first virtual-machine-based platform , though far successful well-known . Previous us virtual machine technology primarily involvedemulatorsto aid development not-yet-developed hardware operate system , JVM design implement entirely software , make easy efficiently port implementation hardware kind .
