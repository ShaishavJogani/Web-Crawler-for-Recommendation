Java consider astrongly typedprogramming language . Thus variable Java programming language ought particulardata type . This either declare infer Java language allow program run adhere type constraint . If present numeric type data numeric , say textual content , declaration would violate Java â€™ type system . This give Java ability oftype safety . Java check expression data encounter incorrect type none . It automatically flag occurrence error compile time . Most type-related error catch Java compiler , hence make program secure safe compile completely successfully . Some language ( C ) define interpretation statement use interpretation without warning ; others ( PL/I ) define conversion almost statement perform conversion complete assignment . Some type error still occur runtime Java support cast operation way change type one expression another . However , Java performs run time type check cast , incorrect type cast cause runtime exception rather succeed silently allow data corruption . On hand , Java also know ahybrid language . While supportingobject orient programming ( OOP ) , Java pure OO language likeSmalltalkorRuby . Instead , Java offer object type andprimitive type . Primitive type use boolean , character , numeric value operation . This allow relatively good performance manipulate numeric data , expense flexibility . For example , subclass primitive type add new operation .
