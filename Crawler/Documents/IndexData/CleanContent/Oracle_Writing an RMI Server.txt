The compute engine server accept task client , run task , return result . The server code consist interface class . The interface define method invoke client . Essentially , interface define client 's view remote object . The class provide implementation . Designing Remote Interface This section explain Compute interface , provide connection client server . You also learn RMI API , support communication . Implementing Remote Interface This section explore class implement Compute interface , thereby implement remote object . This class also provide rest code make server program , include main method create instance remote object , register RMI registry , set security manager .
