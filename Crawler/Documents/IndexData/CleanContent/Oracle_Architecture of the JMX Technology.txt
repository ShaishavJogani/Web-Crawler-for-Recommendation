The JMX technology divide three level , follow : Instrumentation JMX agent Remote management Instrumentation To manage resource use JMX technology , must first instrument resource Java programming language . You use Java object know MBeans implement access resource ' instrumentation . MBeans must follow design pattern interface define JMX specification . Doing ensure MBeans provide manage resource instrumentation standardized way . In addition standard MBeans , JMX specification also define special type MBean call MXBean . An MXBean MBean reference pre-defined set data type . Other type MBean exist , trail concentrate standard MBeans MXBeans . Once resource instrument MBeans , manage JMX agent . MBeans require knowledge JMX agent operate . MBeans design flexible , simple , easy implement . Developers application , system , network make product manageable standard way without understand invest complex management system . Existing resource make manageable minimum effort . In addition , instrumentation level JMX specification provide notification mechanism . This mechanism enable MBeans generate propagate notification event component level . JMX Agent A JMX technology-based agent ( JMX agent ) standard management agent directly control resource make available remote management application . JMX agent usually locate machine resource control , arrangement requirement . The core component JMX agent MBean server , manage object server MBeans register . A JMX agent also include set service manage MBeans , least one communication adaptor connector allow access management application . When implement JMX agent , need know semantics function resource manage . In fact , JMX agent even need know resource serve resource instrument compliance JMX specification use JMX agent offer service resource require . Similarly , JMX agent need know function management application access . Remote Management JMX technology instrumentation access many different way , either exist management protocol Simple Network Management Protocol ( SNMP ) proprietary protocol . The MBean server relies protocol adaptor connector make JMX agent accessible management application outside agent 's Java Virtual Machine ( Java VM ) . Each adaptor provide view specific protocol MBeans register MBean server . For example , HTML adaptor could display MBean browser . Connectors provide manager-side interface handle communication manager JMX agent . Each connector provide remote management interface different protocol . When remote management application use interface , connect JMX agent transparently network , regardless protocol . The JMX technology provide standard solution export JMX technology instrumentation remote application base Java Remote Method Invocation ( Java RMI ) .
