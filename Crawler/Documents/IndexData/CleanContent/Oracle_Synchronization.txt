Threads communicate primarily share access field object reference field refer . This form communication extremely efficient , make two kind error possible : thread interference memory consistency error . The tool need prevent error synchronization . However , synchronization introduce thread contention , occur two thread try access resource simultaneously cause Java runtime execute one thread slowly , even suspend execution . Starvation livelock form thread contention . See section Liveness information . This section cover following topic : Thread Interference describe error introduce multiple thread access share data . Memory Consistency Errors describe error result inconsistent view shared memory . Synchronized Methods describe simple idiom effectively prevent thread interference memory consistency error . Implicit Locks Synchronization describe general synchronization idiom , describe synchronization base implicit lock . Atomic Access talk general idea operation ca n't interfere thread .
