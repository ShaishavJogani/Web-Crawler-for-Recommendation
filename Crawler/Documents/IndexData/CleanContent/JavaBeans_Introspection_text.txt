In Java J2EE programming , call method object cast class interface declare . The structured definition bean property useful compare single common property across several object relate inheritance . For example , program may contain bean represent company 's employee , another contain list building company occupy . A programmer write function calledlistAssetNames ( ) want write simple way get field `` name '' several bean get field Employee Building bean , easily adapt get field type bean may write yet . While could rewrite Employee Building inherit one class name NamedObject , create NamedObject interface , method problem . Using inheritance limit , child class inherit one parent class , limit number different class share property , well number common property share . Furthermore , use inheritance express relationship simple `` is-a '' relationship confuse , look dozen class definition find single `` dumb '' getter function implement . Creating interface fix problem cause multiple inheritance rule , class use number interface , still require every share property explicitly spell . The simple , elegant way deal type relationship read bean property use introspection . The jakartaBeanUtilspackage common way handle object need relate way , take advantage regularity JavaBean name convention .
