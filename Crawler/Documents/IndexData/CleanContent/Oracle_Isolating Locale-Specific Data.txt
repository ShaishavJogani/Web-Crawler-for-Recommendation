Locale-specific data must tailor accord convention end user 's language region . The text display user interface obvious example locale-specific data . For example , application Cancel button U.S. Abbrechen button Germany . In country button label . Obviously n't want hardcode button label . Would n't nice could automatically get correct label give Locale ? Fortunately , provide isolate locale-specific object ResourceBundle . In lesson 'll learn create access ResourceBundle object . If 're hurry examine coding example , go ahead check last two section lesson . Then come back first two section get conceptual information ResourceBundle object . About ResourceBundle Class ResourceBundle object contain locale-specific object . When need locale-specific object , fetch ResourceBundle , return object match end user 's Locale . This section explain ResourceBundle relate Locale , describe ResourceBundle subclass . Preparing Use ResourceBundle Before create ResourceBundle object , little planning . First , identify locale-specific object program . Then organize category store different ResourceBundle object accordingly . Backing ResourceBundle Properties Files If application contain String object need translate various language , store String object PropertyResourceBundle , back set property file . Since property file simple text file , create maintain translator . You n't change source code . In section 'll learn set property file back PropertyResourceBundle . Using ListResourceBundle The ListResourceBundle class , subclass ResourceBundle , manage locale-specific object list . A ListResourceBundle back class file , mean must code compile new source file time support additional Locale need . However , ListResourceBundle object useful unlike property file , store type locale-specific object . By step sample program , section demonstrate use ListResourceBundle . Customizing Resource Bundle Loading This section represent new capability improve ResourceBundle.getBundle factory flexibility . The ResourceBundle.Control class collaborate factory method load resource bundle . This allow consider every substantial step resource bundle-loading process cache control separate method .
