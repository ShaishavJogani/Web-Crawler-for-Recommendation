This trail cover fundamental program Java programming language . Object-Oriented Programming Concepts teach core concept behind object-oriented programming : object , message , class , inheritance . This lesson end show concept translate code . Feel free skip lesson already familiar object-oriented programming . Language Basics describe traditional feature language , include variable , array , data type , operator , control flow . Classes Objects describe write class object create , create use object . Annotations form metadata provide information compiler . This lesson describe use annotation program effectively . Interfaces Inheritance describe interfacesâ€”what , would want write one , write one . This section also describe way derive one class another . That , subclass inherit field method superclass . You learn class derive Object class , modify method subclass inherit superclass . Numbers Strings This lesson describe use Number String object The lesson also show format data output . Generics powerful feature Java programming language . They improve type safety code , make bug detectable compile time . Packages feature Java programming language help organize structure class relationship one another .
