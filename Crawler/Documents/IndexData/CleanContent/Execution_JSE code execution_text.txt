Java language first edition come client-server era . Thick client develop rich GUI interface . Java first edition , JSE ( Java Standard Edition ) had/has following belt : GUI capability ( AWT , Swing ) Network compute capability ( RMI ) Multi-tasking capability ( Threads ) With JSE following Java code execution possible : Figure 1 : Stand alone execution Stand alone Java application ( Figure 1 ) Stand alone application refers Java program user interface business module run computer . The application may may use database persist data . The user interface could either AWT Swing.The application would start amain ( ) method Class . The application stop themain ( ) method exit , exception throw application JVM . Classes load memory compile need , either file system *.jar file , JVM.Invocation Java program distribute manner require usage command line . Once user class file , need launch application following command line ( Main name class contain main ( ) method . ) Execution classjava Main Java 'jar ' class librariesUtility class , framework class , and/or third party class usually package distribute Java ' *.jar ' file . These 'jar ' file need put CLASSPATH java program class go used.If jar file executable , run command line : Execution archivejava -jar Application.jar Client Server applicationsThe client server application consist front-end , back-end part , run separate computer . The idea business logic would back-end part program , would reuse client . Here challenge achieve separation front-end user interface code , back-end business logic code.The communication front-end back-end achieve two ways.One way define data communicationprotocolbetween two tier . The back-end part would listen incoming request . Based theprotocolit interprets request send back result data form.The way useJava Remote Invocation ( RMI ) . With use RMI , remote object create use client . In case Java object transmit across network.More information find client-server programming , sample code , theClient Server Chapterin book .
