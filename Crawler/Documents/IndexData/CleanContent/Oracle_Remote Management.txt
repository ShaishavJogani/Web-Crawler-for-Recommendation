The JMX API enable perform remote management resource use JMX technology-based connector ( JMX connector ) . A JMX connector make MBean server accessible remote Java technology-based client . The client end connector export essentially interface MBean server . A JMX connector consist connector client connector server . A connector server attach MBean server listens connection request client . A connector client responsible establish connection connector server . A connector client usually different Java Virtual Machine ( Java VM ) connector server often run different machine . The JMX API define standard connection protocol base Remote Method Invocation ( RMI ) . This protocol enable connect JMX client MBean MBean server remote location perform operation MBean , exactly operation perform locally . The Java SE platform provide out-of-the-box mean monitor application remotely use JMX API 's standard RMI connector . The out-of-the-box RMI connector automatically expose application remote management , without require create dedicated remote connector server . The out-of-the-box remote management agent activate start Java application correct property . Monitoring management application compatible JMX technology connect application monitor remotely .
