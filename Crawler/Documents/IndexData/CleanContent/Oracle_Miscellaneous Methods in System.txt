This section describe method System n't cover previous section . The arrayCopy method efficiently copy data array . For information , refer Arrays Language Basics lesson . The currentTimeMillis nanoTime method useful measure time interval execution application . To measure time interval millisecond , invoke currentTimeMillis twice , beginning end interval , subtract first value return second . Similarly , invoke nanoTime twice measure interval nanosecond . Note : The accuracy currentTimeMillis nanoTime limit time service provide operating system . Do assume currentTimeMillis accurate near millisecond nanoTime accurate near nanosecond . Also , neither currentTimeMillis nanoTime use determine current time . Use high-level method , java.util.Calendar.getInstance . The exit method cause Java virtual machine shut , integer exit status specify argument . The exit status available process launch application . By convention , exit status 0 indicates normal termination application , value error code .
