The Just-In-Time ( JIT ) compiler compiler convert byte-code machine code . It compile byte-code compiled machine code re-used , speed execution . Early Java compiler compile byte-code machine code time use , modern compiler cache machine code reuse machine . Even , java 's JIT compiling still fast `` interpreter-language '' , code compile fromhigh level language , instead byte-code time use . The standard JIT compiler runson demand . When method call repeatedly , JIT compiler analyze bytecode produce highly efficient machine code , run fast . The JIT compiler smart enough recognize code already compile , application run , compilation happen need . As Java application run , tend become faster faster , JIT perform runtime profiling optimization code meet execution environment . Methods code block run often receive less optimization ; run often ( calledhotspots ) receive profiling optimization . InstallationJava ProgrammingCompilationExecution
