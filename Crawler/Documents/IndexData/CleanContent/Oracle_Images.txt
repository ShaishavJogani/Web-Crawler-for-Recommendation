In Java 2D API image typically rectangular two-dimensional array pixel , pixel represent color position image dimension represent horizontal extent ( width ) vertical extent ( height ) image display . The important image class represent image java.awt.image.BufferedImage class . The Java 2D API store content image memory directly access . Applications directly create BufferedImage object obtain image external image format PNG GIF . In either case , application draw image use Java 2D API graphic call . So , image limit display photographic type image . Different object line art , text , graphic even image draw onto image ( show following image ) . The Java 2D API enables apply image filter operation BufferedImage include several built-in filter . For example , ConvolveOp filter use blur sharpen image . The resulting image draw screen , send printer , save graphic format PNG , GIF etc . To learn image see Working Images lesson .
