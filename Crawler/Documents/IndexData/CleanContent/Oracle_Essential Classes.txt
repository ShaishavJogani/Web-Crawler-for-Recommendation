This trail discuss class Java platform essential programmer . Exceptions explain exception mechanism use handle error exceptional condition . This lesson describe exception , throw catch exception , exception catch , use exception class hierarchy . Basic I/O cover Java platform class use basic input output . It focus primarily I/O Streams , powerful concept greatly simplify I/O operation . The lesson also look Serialization , let program write whole object stream read back . Then lesson look file system operation , include random access file . Finally , touch briefly advanced feature New I/O API . Concurrency explain write application perform multiple task simultaneously . The Java platform design ground support concurrent programming , basic concurrency support Java programming language Java class library . Since version 5.0 , Java platform also include high-level concurrency APIs . This lesson introduce platform 's basic concurrency support summarize high-level APIs java.util.concurrent package . The Platform Environment define underlie operating system , Java virtual machine , class library , various configuration data supply application launch . This lesson describe APIs application use examine configure platform environment . Regular Expressions way describe set string base common characteristic share string set . They use search , edit , manipulate text data . Regular expression vary complexity , understand basic 're construct , 'll able decipher ( create ) regular expression . This lesson teach regular expression syntax support java.util.regex API , present several work example illustrate various object interact .
