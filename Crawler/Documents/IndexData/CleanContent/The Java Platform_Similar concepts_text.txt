The success Java platform concept write , run anywhere principle lead development similar framework platform . Most notable Microsoft's.NET frameworkand open-source equivalentMono . The .NET framework [ edit ] The .NET framework borrow many concept innovation Java — alternative JVM call theCommon Language Runtime ( CLR ) , alternative byte-code theCommon Intermediate Language ( CIL ) . In fact , .NET platform implementation Java-like language calledVisual J # ( formerly know asJ++ ) . J # normally support JVM instead compile Java byte-code , .NET platform compile code CIL , thus make J # different Java programming language . Furthermore , J # implement .NET Base Class Libraries ( BCL ) instead Java Class Libraries , J # nothing non-standard extension Java programming language . Due lack interest developer , Microsoft withdraw support J # , focus similar programming language : C # . Third-party compiler target JVM [ edit ] The word Java , , usually refers Java programming language design use Java platform . Programming language typically outside scope phrase `` platform '' . However , Oracle encourage use language platform , list Java programming language core part Java 2 platform . The language runtime therefore commonly consider single unit . There case might want program use different language ( say , Python ) yet able generate Java byte-code ( instead Python compile code ) run JVM . Many third-party programming language vendor provide compiler compile code write language Java byte-code . For instance , Python developer useJythoncompilers compile Python code Java byte-code format ( illustrate ) . Figure 5 : Third-party JVM-targeted compilation non-Java source compilation Java byte-code . Illustrated exampleshows Python source compile Python compile code Java byte-code . Of late , JVM-targeted third-party programming scripting language see tremendous growth . Some language also use extend functionality Java language . A example include following : GroovyPizzaGJ ( Generic Java ) – later officially incorporate Java SE 5.NetREXX Java OverviewJava ProgrammingThe Java PlatformGetting start
