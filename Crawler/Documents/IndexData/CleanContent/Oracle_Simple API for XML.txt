This lesson focus Simple API XML ( SAX ) , event-driven , serial-access mechanism access XML document . This protocol frequently use servlets network-oriented program need transmit receive XML document , fast least memory-intensive mechanism currently available deal XML document , Streaming API XML ( StAX ) . Note - In nutshell , SAX orient towards state independent processing , handling element depend element come . StAX , hand , orient towards state dependent processing . For detailed comparison , see When Use SAX . Setting program use SAX require bit work set use Document Object Model ( DOM ) . SAX event-driven model ( provide callback method , parser invoke read XML data ) , make hard visualize . Finally , `` back '' early part document , rearrange , back serial data stream rearrange character read stream . For reason , developer write user-oriented application display XML document possibly modifies want use DOM mechanism describe Document Object Model . However , even plan build DOM application exclusively , several important reason familiarize SAX model : Same Error Handling : The kind exception generate SAX DOM APIs , error handle code virtually identical . Handling Validation Errors : By default , specification require validation error ignore . If want throw exception event validation error ( probably ) , need understand SAX error handle work . Converting Existing Data : As see Document Object Model , mechanism use convert exist data set XML . However , take advantage mechanism require understanding SAX model .
