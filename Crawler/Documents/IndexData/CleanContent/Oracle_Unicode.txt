Unicode compute industry standard design consistently uniquely encode character use write language throughout world . The Unicode standard use hexadecimal express character . For example , value 0x0041 represent Latin character A . The Unicode standard initially design use 16 bit encode character primary machine 16-bit PCs . When specification Java language create , Unicode standard accept char primitive define 16-bit data type , character hexadecimal range 0x0000 0xFFFF . Because 16-bit encoding support 216 ( 65,536 ) character , insufficient define character use throughout world , Unicode standard extend 0x10FFFF , support one million character . The definition character Java programming language could change 16 bit 32 bit without cause million Java application long run properly . To correct definition , scheme develop handle character could encode 16 bit . The character value outside 16-bit range , within range 0x10000 0x10FFFF , call supplementary character define pair char value . This lesson include following section : Terminology – Code point term explain . Supplementary Characters Surrogates – 16-bit surrogate use implement supplementary character , implement single primitive char data type . Character String API – A listing related API Character , String , related class . Sample Usage – Several useful code snippet provide . Design Considerations – Design consideration keep mind ensure application work language script . More Information – A list resource provide .
