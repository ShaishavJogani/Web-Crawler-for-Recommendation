Computers run Internet communicate use either Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) , diagram illustrate : When write Java program communicate network , program application layer . Typically , n't need concern TCP UDP layer . Instead , use class java.net package . These class provide system-independent network communication . However , decide Java class program use , need understand TCP UDP differ . TCP When two application want communicate reliably , establish connection send data back forth connection . This analogous make telephone call . If want speak Aunt Beatrice Kentucky , connection establish dial phone number answer . You send data back forth connection speak one another phone line . Like phone company , TCP guarantee data send one end connection actually get end order send . Otherwise , error report . TCP provide point-to-point channel application require reliable communication . The Hypertext Transfer Protocol ( HTTP ) , File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) , Telnet example application require reliable communication channel . The order data sent receive network critical success application . When HTTP use read URL , data must receive order send . Otherwise , end jumbled HTML file , corrupt zip file , invalid information . Definition : TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol ) connection-based protocol provide reliable flow data two computer . UDP The UDP protocol provide communication guarantee two application network . UDP connection-based like TCP . Rather , send independent packet data , call datagrams , one application another . Sending datagrams much like send letter postal service : The order delivery important guarantee , message independent . Definition : UDP ( User Datagram Protocol ) protocol send independent packet data , call datagrams , one computer another guarantee arrival . UDP connection-based like TCP . For many application , guarantee reliability critical success transfer information one end connection . However , form communication n't require strict standard . In fact , may slow extra overhead reliable connection may invalidate service altogether . Consider , example , clock server send current time client request . If client miss packet , n't really make sense resend time incorrect client receive second try . If client make two request receives packet server order , n't really matter client figure packet order make another request . The reliability TCP unnecessary instance cause performance degradation may hinder usefulness service . Another example service n't need guarantee reliable channel ping command . The purpose ping command test communication two program network . In fact , ping need know dropped out-of-order packet determine good bad connection . A reliable channel would invalidate service altogether . The UDP protocol provide communication guarantee two application network . UDP connection-based like TCP . Rather , send independent packet data one application another . Sending datagrams much like send letter mail service : The order delivery important guarantee , message independent others . Note : Many firewall router configure allow UDP packet . If 're trouble connect service outside firewall , client trouble connect service , ask system administrator UDP permit . Understanding Ports Generally speaking , computer single physical connection network . All data destine particular computer arrive connection . However , data may intend different application run computer . So computer know application forward data ? Through use port . Data transmit Internet accompany address information identify computer port destine . The computer identify 32-bit IP address , IP use deliver data right computer network . Ports identify 16-bit number , TCP UDP use deliver data right application . In connection-based communication TCP , server application bind socket specific port number . This effect register server system receive data destine port . A client rendezvous server server 's port , illustrate : Definition : The TCP UDP protocol use port map incoming data particular process run computer . In datagram-based communication UDP , datagram packet contain port number destination UDP rout packet appropriate application , illustrate figure : Port number range 0 65,535 port represent 16-bit number . The port number range 0 - 1023 restrict ; reserve use well-known service HTTP FTP system service . These port call well-known port . Your application attempt bind . Networking Classes JDK Through class java.net , Java program use TCP UDP communicate Internet . The URL , URLConnection , Socket , ServerSocket class use TCP communicate network . The DatagramPacket , DatagramSocket , MulticastSocket class use UDP .
