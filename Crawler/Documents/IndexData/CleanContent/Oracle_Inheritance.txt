In preceding lesson , see inheritance mention several time . In Java language , class derive class , thereby inherit field method class . Definitions : A class derive another class call subclass ( also derived class , extend class , child class ) . The class subclass derive call superclass ( also base class parent class ) . Excepting Object , superclass , every class one one direct superclass ( single inheritance ) . In absence explicit superclass , every class implicitly subclass Object . Classes derive class derive class derive class , , ultimately derive topmost class , Object . Such class say descend class inheritance chain stretch back Object . The idea inheritance simple powerful : When want create new class already class include code want , derive new class exist class . In , reuse field method exist class without write ( debug ! ) . A subclass inherit member ( field , method , nested class ) superclass . Constructors member , inherit subclass , constructor superclass invoke subclass . The Java Platform Class Hierarchy The Object class , define java.lang package , defines implement behavior common classesâ€”including one write . In Java platform , many class derive directly Object , class derive class , , form hierarchy class .
