The Java Management Extensions ( JMX ) technology standard part Java Platform , Standard Edition ( Java SE platform ) . The JMX technology add platform Java 2 Platform , Standard Edition ( J2SE ) 5.0 release . The JMX technology provide simple , standard way manage resource application , device , service . Because JMX technology dynamic , use monitor manage resource create , instal implement . You also use JMX technology monitor manage Java Virtual Machine ( Java VM ) . The JMX specification define architecture , design pattern , APIs , service Java programming language management monitoring application network . Using JMX technology , give resource instrument one Java object know Managed Beans , MBeans . These MBeans register core-managed object server , know MBean server . The MBean server act management agent run device enable Java programming language . The specification define JMX agent use manage resource correctly configure management . A JMX agent consist MBean server , MBeans register , set service handle MBeans . In way , JMX agents directly control resource make available remote management application . The way resource instrument completely independent management infrastructure . Resources therefore render manageable regardless management application implement . The JMX technology defines standard connector ( know JMX connector ) enable access JMX agent remote management application . JMX connector use different protocol provide management interface . Consequently , management application manage resource transparently , regardless communication protocol use . JMX agent also use system application compliant JMX specification , long system application support JMX agent .
