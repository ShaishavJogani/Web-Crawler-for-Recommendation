The JMX technology provide developer flexible mean instrument Java technology-based application ( Java application ) , create smart agent , implement distribute management middleware manager , smoothly integrate solution exist management monitoring system . The JMX technology enable Java application manage without heavy investment . A JMX technology-based agent ( JMX agent ) run Java technology-enabled device . Consequently , Java application become manageable little impact design . A Java application need embed managed object server make functionality available one several manage bean ( MBeans ) register object server . That take benefit management infrastructure . The JMX technology provide standard way manage Java application , system , network . For example , Java Platform , Enterprise Edition ( Java EE ) 5 Application Server conform JMX architecture consequently manage use JMX technology . The JMX technology use out-of-the-box management Java VM . The Java Virtual Machine ( Java VM ) highly instrumented use JMX technology . You start JMX agent access built-in Java VM instrumentation , thereby monitor manage Java VM remotely . The JMX technology provide scalable , dynamic management architecture . Every JMX agent service independent module plug management agent , depend requirement . This component-based approach mean JMX solution scale small-footprint device large telecommunication switch beyond . The JMX specification provide set core agent service . Additional service develop dynamically load , unloaded , update management infrastructure . The JMX technology leverage exist standard Java technology . Whenever need , JMX specification reference exist Java specification , example , Java Naming Directory Interface ( J.N.D.I . ) API . The JMX technology-based application ( JMX application ) create NetBeans IDE module . You obtain module NetBeans Update Center ( select Tools - > Update Center NetBeans interface ) enable create JMX application use NetBeans IDE . This reduce cost development JMX application . The JMX technology integrates exist management solution emerge technology . The JMX APIs open interface management system vendor implement . JMX solution use lookup discovery service protocol Jini network technology Service Location Protocol ( SLP ) .
