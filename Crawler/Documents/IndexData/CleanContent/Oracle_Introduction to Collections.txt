A collection — sometimes call container — simply object group multiple element single unit . Collections use store , retrieve , manipulate , communicate aggregate data . Typically , represent data item form natural group , poker hand ( collection card ) , mail folder ( collection letter ) , telephone directory ( mapping name phone number ) . If use Java programming language — programming language — already familiar collection . What Is Collections Framework ? A collection framework unified architecture represent manipulate collection . All collection framework contain following : Interfaces : These abstract data type represent collection . Interfaces allow collection manipulate independently detail representation . In object-oriented language , interface generally form hierarchy . Implementations : These concrete implementation collection interface . In essence , reusable data structure . Algorithms : These method perform useful computation , search sort , object implement collection interface . The algorithm say polymorphic : , method use many different implementation appropriate collection interface . In essence , algorithm reusable functionality . Apart Java Collections Framework , best-known example collection framework C++ Standard Template Library ( STL ) Smalltalk 's collection hierarchy . Historically , collection framework quite complex , give reputation steep learning curve . We believe Java Collections Framework break tradition , learn chapter . Benefits Java Collections Framework The Java Collections Framework provide following benefit : Reduces program effort : By provide useful data structure algorithm , Collections Framework free concentrate important part program rather low-level `` plumbing '' require make work . By facilitate interoperability among unrelated APIs , Java Collections Framework free write adapter object conversion code connect APIs . Increases program speed quality : This Collections Framework provide high-performance , high-quality implementation useful data structure algorithm . The various implementation interface interchangeable , program easily tune switch collection implementation . Because 're free drudgery write data structure , 'll time devote improve program ' quality performance . Allows interoperability among unrelated APIs : The collection interface vernacular APIs pas collection back forth . If network administration API furnish collection node name GUI toolkit expect collection column heading , APIs interoperate seamlessly , even though write independently . Reduces effort learn use new APIs : Many APIs naturally take collection input furnish output . In past , API small sub-API devote manipulate collection . There little consistency among ad hoc collection sub-APIs , learn one scratch , easy make mistake use . With advent standard collection interface , problem go away . Reduces effort design new APIs : This flip side previous advantage . Designers implementers n't reinvent wheel time create API rely collection ; instead , use standard collection interface . Fosters software reuse : New data structure conform standard collection interface nature reusable . The go new algorithm operate object implement interface .
