Application Server 9.1 include Sun Microsystems ’ JSR 173 ( StAX ) implementation , call Sun Java Streaming XML Parser ( refer Streaming XML Parser ) . The Streaming XML Parser high-speed , non-validating , W3C XML 1.0 Namespace 1.0-compliant streaming XML pull parser build upon Xerces2 codebase . In Sun ’ Streaming XML Parser implementation , Xerces2 low layer , particularly Scanner related class , redesign behave pull fashion . In addition change low layer , Streaming XML Parser include additional StAX-related functionality many performance-enhancing improvement . The Streaming XML Parser implement appserv-ws.jar javaee.jar file , locate install_dir/lib/ directory . Included JAXP reference implementation StAX code example , locate INSTALL_DIR/jaxp-version/samples/stax directory , illustrate Sun ’ Streaming XML Parser implementation work . These example describe Example Code . Before proceed example code , two aspect Streaming XML Parser aware : Reporting CDATA Events Streaming XML Parser Factories Implementation These topic discuss . Reporting CDATA Events The javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader implement Streaming XML Parser report CDATA event . If application need receive event , configure XMLInputFactory set following implementation-specific report-cdata-event property : XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInptuFactory.newInstance ( ) ; factory.setProperty ( `` report-cdata-event '' , Boolean.TRUE ) ; Streaming XML Parser Factories Implementation Most application need know factory implementation class name . Just add javaee.jar appserv-ws.jar file classpath sufficient application two jar supply factory implementation classname various Streaming XML Parser property META-INF/services directory—for example , javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory , javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory , javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory—which third step lookup operation application ask factory instance . See Javadoc XMLInputFactory.newInstance method information lookup mechanism . However , may scenario application would like know factory implementation class name set property explicitly . These scenario could include case multiple JSR 173 implementation classpath application want choose one , perhaps one superior performance , contain crucial bug fix , suchlike . If application set SystemProperty , first step lookup operation , obtain factory instance would fast compare option ; example : javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory -- > com.sun.xml.stream.ZephyrParserFactory javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory -- > com.sun.xml.stream.ZephyrWriterFactor javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory -- > com.sun.xml.stream.events.ZephyrEventFactory
