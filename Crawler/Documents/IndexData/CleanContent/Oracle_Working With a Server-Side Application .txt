Java applet , like Java program , use API define java.net package communicate across network . A Java applet communicate server application run host applet . This communication require special setup server . Note : Depending networking environment applet load , depend browser run applet , applet might unable communicate originate host . For example , browser run host inside firewall often obtain much information world outside firewall . As result , browser might allow applet communication host outside firewall . When applet deploy web server , use Applet getCodeBase method java.net.URL getHost method determine host applet come , follow : String host = getCodeBase ( ) .getHost ( ) ; If applet deploy locally , getCodeBase method return null . Use web server recommend . After correct host name , use networking code document Custom Networking trail . Note : Not browser support networking code flawlessly . For example , one widely use browser compatible Java technology n't support post URL . For example implement applet network client , see Network Client Applet Example .
