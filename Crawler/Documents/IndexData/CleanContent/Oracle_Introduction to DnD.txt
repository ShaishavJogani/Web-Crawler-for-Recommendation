If write application want support ability transfer information component application . But also want application play well others — include support ability transfer information application Java application , application native application . The ability transfer data take two form : Drag drop ( DnD ) support . The following diagram illustrate drag JList drop onto JTextField component ( arrow show path data ) : Clipboard transfer cut copy paste . The following diagram show cut ( copy ) JList paste onto JTextField component : Drag Drop — Behind Scenes Let u say user name Rollo , run Java application . He want drag text list deposit text field . ( Note process drag native application Java application . ) In nutshell , drag drop process work like : Rollo select row text source component : list . While hold mouse button Rollo begin drag text — initiate drag gesture . When drag begin , list package data export declare source action support , COPY , MOVE , LINK . As Rollo drag data , Swing continuously calculate location handle rendering . If Rollo simultaneously hold Shift and/or Control key drag , user action also part drag gesture . Typically , ordinary drag request MOVE action . Holding Control key drag request COPY action , hold Shift Control request LINK action . Once Rollo drag text bound text field component , target continually poll see accept reject potential drop . As drag , target provide feedback show drop location , perhaps insertion cursor highlighted selection . In case , text field ( current target ) allow replacement select text insertion new text . When Rollo release mouse button , text component inspect declared source action user action choose want available option . In case , text field choose insert new text point drop . Finally , text field import data . While might seem like daunting process , Swing handle work . The framework design plug detail specific component , rest `` work '' . More next section . Note : We recommend create drag drop support use AWT class . This implementation would require significant complex support internal component . Prior release 1.4 dnd system rework , developer occasionally create dnd support , work sophisticated component , like tree table , subtle selection drop issue .
