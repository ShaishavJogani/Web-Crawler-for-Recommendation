The following guideline provide step take reduce vulnerability Rich Internet Applications ( RIAs ) provide user . Follow Secure Coding Guidelines Test Latest Version JRE Include Manifest Attributes Use Signed JNLP File Sign Time Stamp JAR Files Use HTTPS Protocol Avoid Local RIAs Follow Secure Coding Guidelines Follow recommendation Secure Coding Guidelines Java Programming Language . Section 4 , `` Accessibility Extensibility '' describe limit accessibility class package , reduce vulnerability code . JavaScript code consider insecure restrict security sandbox default . Minimize interaction RIA JavaScript code . Use AccessController.doPrivileged block care allow access HTML page JavaScript code . Test Latest Version JRE Make sure RIA run late , secure version JRE . The Java platform support ability RIAs specify Java version need run RIA , however , require user maintain one version JRE , especially old , insecure version , security risk user . One benefit RIAs updated version RIA automatically download user 's system . Test RIA update JRE make sure work . If change need , update RIA server user install late JRE still run RIA . Include Manifest Attributes Add attribute JAR file manifest describe property RIA . Values JNLP file applet tag compare value manifest verify correct code run . Request sandbox permission RIA require access beyond security sandbox . The Java sandbox provide additional protection user , user might run privileged application understand request unrestricted access system . Manifest attribute also use identify location RIA access . This include location JavaScript code call RIA , location JNLP file applet tag start RIA . See Enhancing Security Manifest Attributes information manifest attribute available . Use Signed JNLP File If RIA need access non-secure system property JVM argument , use signed JNLP . If variation external internal JNLP file require , use JNLP template . See Signed JNLP Files Java Platform , Standard Edition Deployment Guide information . To access non-secure system property JVM argument , include property argument JNLP file describe Setting Trusted Arguments Secure Properties . Sign Time Stamp JAR Files Obtain code sign certificate trusted certificate authority use sign JAR file RIA . Deploy user RIAs sign valid certificate . When sign JAR file , also time stamp signature . Time stamp verifies certificate valid time JAR sign , RIA automatically block certificate expire . See Signing JAR Files information signing time stamping . Self-signed unsigned RIAs consider unsafe allow run unless exception site list deployment rule set set allow specific application . However , self-signing useful test purpose . To test use self-signed RIA , import self-signed certificate trust keystore . Use HTTPS Protocol Use HTTPS protocol web server user get RIA . The HTTPS protocol encrypt validate server , make difficult anyone tamper RIA . Avoid Local RIAs Local RIAs intend use production . To ensure user run code intend run , host RIA application server . For test , use web server recommend . Another option add application exception site list , manage Security tab Java Control Panel .
