Up , 've assume creation variable single statement . In essence , assign value variable , 's call . When assign value variable statement , statement call anassignment statement ( also call aninitialization statement ) . Did notice one thing ? It 's semicolon ( ; ) , end statement . A clear indicator line code statement termination end semicolon . If one write multiple statement , usually statement separate line end semicolon . Consider example : You necessarily use new line write statement . Just like English , begin write next statement end first one depict : However , problem put multiple statement one line , 's difficult read . It n't look intimidate first , 've get significant amount code , 's usually good organize way make sense . It would look complex incomprehensible write Listing 3.4 . Now look anatomy simple assignment statement , look back 've achieve . We know ... A statement unit code programming.If assign variable value , statement call assignment statement.An assignment statement include three part : data type , variable name ( also call identifier ) value variable . We look nature identifier value sectionVariableslater . Now , move next topic , need try understand code . The first two statement pretty much similar inSection 3.3but different variable name . The third however bit interesting . We 've already talk variable similar gift box . Think computer 's memory shelf put box . Whenever need box ( variable ) , call identifier ( 's name variable ) . So call variable identifierfirstNumbergives number10 , callingsecondNumberwould give you20hence add two , answer be30 . That 's value last variableresultwould . The part third statement add number , i.e. , firstNumber + secondNumberis call anexpressionand expression decide value . If 's plain value , like first two statement , 's call aliteral ( value isliterallythe value , hence nameliteral ) . Note assignment toresultits value change assign different value tofirstNumberorsecondNumber , like line 5 . With information attain , actually write decent Java program sum value .
