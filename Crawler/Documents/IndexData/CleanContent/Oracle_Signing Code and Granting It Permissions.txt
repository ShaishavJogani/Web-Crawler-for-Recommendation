This lesson show use use keytool , jarsigner , Policy Tool jar place file JAR ( Java ARchive ) file subsequent signing jarsigner tool . This lesson two part . First , create deploy application . Second ; act recipient signed application . Here step create deploy application : Note : For convenience , pretend user/developer name Susan Jones . You need define Susan Jones generate key . Put Java class file comprise application JAR file Sign JAR file Export public key certificate correspond private key use sign JAR file Here step grant permission application Note : For convenience , pretend user name Ray . You see signed application normally read file run security manager . Use keytool import certificate Ray 's keystore entry aliased susan Use Policy Tool create entry Ray 's policy file permit code sign susan read specify file . Finally , see application run security manager read file , since grant permission . For information digital signature , certificate , keystores , tool , see API Tools Use Secure Code File Exchanges lesson . Important : You need perform task lesson work directory store sample application , store data file need application different directory . All example trail assume work C : \Test directory , data file C : \TestData directory . If work UNIX system , substitute directory name . Here step : Steps Code Signer Steps Code Receiver
