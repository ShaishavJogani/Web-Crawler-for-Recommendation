Object orient programming represent withUMLdiagrams . Object orientation ( `` OO '' ) refers method programming language technique . The main idea OO design software around `` thing '' ( i.e . object ) manipulate , rather action perform . As hardware computer advance , bring need create good software technique able create ever increase complex application . The intent make large software project easy manage , thus improve quality reduce number failed project . Object oriented solution late software technique . Assembly languagesSoftware technique start assembly languages , close machine instruction easy convert executable code . Each hardware assembly language . Assembly language contain low level instruction like move data memory hardware register , arithmetic operation , move data back memory . Programmers know detailed architecture computer order write program . Procedural languagesAfter assembly languages , high level language develop . Here language compiler use convert high level program machine instruction , free programmer burden know computer hardware architecture . To promote re-use code minimize use GOTO instruction , `` procedural '' technique introduce . This simplify creation maintenance software control flow , leave organization data . It become nightmare debug maintain program many global variable ( i.e . variable contain data modify anywhere application ) . Object orient languagesIn OO language , data take seriously information hiding . Data specific object access procedure object . As result , object contain data well control flow program become series interaction object .
