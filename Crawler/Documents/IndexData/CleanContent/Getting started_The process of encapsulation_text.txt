By , thoroughly understand object interact environment turn influence . In example , theAnimalobject expose certain field –nameandlegs , method –walk ( ) use environment manipulate object . This form exposure implicit . Using Java programming language , programmer power define level access object environment certain object . Using access modifier [ edit ] Alongside declare define object , field method , programmer also ability define level access element . This use keywords know asaccess modifier . Let 's modify example demonstrate effect : By declare field methodspublic , ensure use outside scope theAnimalclass . This mean object ( thanAnimal ) access member element . However , restrict access certain member element class , always use theprivateaccess modifier ( demonstrate ) . In example , fieldsnameandlegscan access within scope theAnimalclass . No object outside scope class access two field . However , since thewalk ( ) method still haspublicaccess , manipulate actor object outside scope class . Access modifier limit field method , use class definition well ( demonstrate ) . The following list keywords show valid access modifier use Java program : keyworddescriptionpublicOpens access certain field method use outside scope class.privateRestricts access certain field method use within scope class.protectedAccess certain field method reserve class inherit current class.More would discuss section oninheritance .
