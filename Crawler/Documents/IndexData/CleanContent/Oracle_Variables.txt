As learn previous lesson , object store state field . int cadence = 0 ; int speed = 0 ; int gear = 1 ; The What Is Object ? discussion introduce field , probably still question , : What rule convention name field ? Besides int , data type ? Do field initialize declare ? Are field assign default value explicitly initialize ? We 'll explore answer question lesson , , technical distinction must first become aware . In Java programming language , term `` field '' `` variable '' use ; common source confusion among new developer , since often seem refer thing . The Java programming language define following kind variable : Instance Variables ( Non-Static Fields ) Technically speak , object store individual state `` non-static field '' , , field declare without static keyword . Non-static field also know instance variable value unique instance class ( object , word ) ; currentSpeed one bicycle independent currentSpeed another . Class Variables ( Static Fields ) A class variable field declare static modifier ; tell compiler exactly one copy variable existence , regardless many time class instantiate . A field define number gear particular kind bicycle could mark static since conceptually number gear apply instance . The code static int numGears = 6 ; would create static field . Additionally , keyword final could add indicate number gear never change . Local Variables Similar object store state field , method often store temporary state local variable . The syntax declare local variable similar declare field ( example , int count = 0 ; ) . There special keyword designate variable local ; determination come entirely location variable declare — opening closing brace method . As , local variable visible method declare ; accessible rest class . Parameters You 've already see example parameter , Bicycle class main method `` Hello World ! '' application . Recall signature main method public static void main ( String [ ] args ) . Here , args variable parameter method . The important thing remember parameter always classify `` variable '' `` field '' . This apply parameter-accepting construct well ( constructor exception handler ) 'll learn later tutorial . Having say , remainder tutorial use following general guideline discuss field variable . If talk `` field general '' ( exclude local variable parameter ) , may simply say `` field '' . If discussion apply `` '' , may simply say `` variable '' . If context call distinction , use specific term ( static field , local variable , etc . ) appropriate . You may also occasionally see term `` member '' use well . A type 's field , method , nested type collectively call member . Naming Every programming language set rule convention kind name 're allow use , Java programming language different . The rule convention name variable summarize follow : Variable name case-sensitive . A variable 's name legal identifier — unlimited-length sequence Unicode letter digit , begin letter , dollar sign `` $ '' , underscore character `` _ '' . The convention , however , always begin variable name letter , `` $ '' `` _ '' . Additionally , dollar sign character , convention , never use . You may find situation auto-generated name contain dollar sign , variable name always avoid use . A similar convention exists underscore character ; 's technically legal begin variable 's name `` _ '' , practice discourage . White space permit . Subsequent character may letter , digit , dollar sign , underscore character . Conventions ( common sense ) apply rule well . When choose name variable , use full word instead cryptic abbreviation . Doing make code easy read understand . In many case also make code self-documenting ; field name cadence , speed , gear , example , much intuitive abbreviated version , , c , g. Also keep mind name choose must keyword reserve word . If name choose consists one word , spell word lowercase letter . If consist one word , capitalize first letter subsequent word . The name gearRatio currentGear prime example convention . If variable store constant value , static final int NUM_GEARS = 6 , convention change slightly , capitalize every letter separate subsequent word underscore character . By convention , underscore character never use elsewhere .
