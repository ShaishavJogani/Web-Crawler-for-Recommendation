In class , several method name . However must differentsignature . The signature method comprise name , parameter type order parameter . The signature method isnotcomprised return type visibility exception may throw . The practice define two method within class share name different parameter calledoverloading method . Methods name class calledoverloaded method . Overloading method offer specific benefit JVM useful programmer several method thing different parameter . For example , may operationrunAroundTherepresented two method name , different input parameter type : One type subclass : Although method would fit call method theStringparameter , method near type call instead . To accurate , call method whose parameter type subclass parameter type method . So , aObjectwill outputObject . Beware ! The parameter type define thedeclaredtype object , notitsinstantiatedtype ! The following two method definition valid type order different . If input parameter type String , would problem since compiler would able distinguish two : The compiler would give error following method definition well : Note , return type part unique signature . Why ? The reason method call without assign return value variable . This feature come C C++ . So call : compiler would know method call . It also case thrown exception .
