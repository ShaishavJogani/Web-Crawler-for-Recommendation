So far , lesson focus low-level APIs part Java platform beginning . These APIs adequate basic task , higher-level building block need advanced task . This especially true massively concurrent application fully exploit today 's multiprocessor multi-core system . In section 'll look high-level concurrency feature introduce version 5.0 Java platform . Most feature implement new java.util.concurrent package . There also new concurrent data structure Java Collections Framework . Lock object support lock idiom simplify many concurrent application . Executors define high-level API launch manage thread . Executor implementation provide java.util.concurrent provide thread pool management suitable large-scale application . Concurrent collection make easy manage large collection data , greatly reduce need synchronization . Atomic variable feature minimize synchronization help avoid memory consistency error . ThreadLocalRandom ( JDK 7 ) provide efficient generation pseudorandom number multiple thread .
