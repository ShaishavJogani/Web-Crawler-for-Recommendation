Implementations data object use store collection , implement interface describe Interfaces lesson . The Java Collections Framework provide several general-purpose implementation core interface : For Set interface , HashSet commonly used implementation . For List interface , ArrayList commonly used implementation . For Map interface , HashMap commonly used implementation . For Queue interface , LinkedList commonly used implementation . For Deque interface , ArrayDeque commonly used implementation . Each general-purpose implementation provide optional operation contain interface . The Java Collections Framework also provide several special-purpose implementation situation require nonstandard performance , usage restriction , unusual behavior . The java.util.concurrent package contain several collection implementation , thread-safe govern single exclusion lock . The Collections class ( oppose Collection interface ) , provide static method operate return collection , know Wrapper implementation . Finally , several Convenience implementation , efficient general-purpose implementation n't need full power . The Convenience implementation make available static factory method .
