The Path class include various method use obtain information path , access element path , convert path form , extract portion path . There also method match path string method remove redundancy path . This lesson address Path method , sometimes call syntactic operation , operate path n't access file system . This section cover following : Creating Path Retrieving Information About Path Removing Redundancies Path Converting Path Joining Two Paths Creating Path Between Two Paths Comparing Two Paths Creating Path A Path instance contain information use specify location file directory . At time define , Path provide series one name . A root element file name might include , neither require . A Path might consist single directory file name . You easily create Path object use one following get method Paths ( note plural ) helper class : Path p1 = Paths.get ( `` /tmp/foo '' ) ; Path p2 = Paths.get ( args [ 0 ] ) ; Path p3 = Paths.get ( URI.create ( `` file : ///Users/joe/FileTest.java '' ) ) ; The Paths.get method shorthand following code : Path p4 = FileSystems.getDefault ( ) .getPath ( `` /users/sally '' ) ; The following example create /u/joe/logs/foo.log assume home directory /u/joe , C : \joe\logs\foo.log Windows . Path p5 = Paths.get ( System.getProperty ( `` user.home '' ) , '' log '' , `` foo.log '' ) ; Retrieving Information Path You think Path store name element sequence . The high element directory structure would locate index 0 . The low element directory structure would locate index [ n-1 ] , n number name element Path . Methods available retrieve individual element subsequence Path use index . The example lesson use following directory structure .
