C++ build atop C language result divergent way thing manifest around language . For instance , create object could three different way C++ . Furthermore , C++ come standard library bundle compiler . Instead , rely resource create programmer ; code rarely fit together . In Java , standardized library provide allow access feature host machine ( graphic network ) unified way . The Java language also include support multi-threaded programs—a necessity many networking application . Platform independent Java , however , successful server side application , web service , servlets , Enterprise JavaBeans . Swing rely underlying native user interface . Java also make progress client side , first hadAbstract Window Toolkit ( AWT ) , thenSwing , recent client side library theStandard Widget Toolkit ( SWT ) . It interest see try handle two oppose consume force . Those : Efficient , fast code ; port popular hardware ( write , test anywhere ) Use underlying native subroutine create GUI component . This approach take AWT , SWT . Portability hardware JVM port ( write , run anywhere ) To achieve latter , Java toolkit rely underlying native user interface . Swing take approach . It interest see approach switch back forth . AWT → Swing → SWT .
