As already learn Images lesson , Images describe width height , measure pixel , coordinate system independent draw surface . There number common task work image . Loading external GIF , PNG JPEG image format file internal image representation use Java 2D . Directly create Java 2D image render . Drawing content Java 2D image draw surface . Saving content Java 2D image external GIF , PNG , JPEG image file . This lesson teach basic loading , displaying , save image . The two main class must learn work image : The java.awt.Image class superclass represent graphical image rectangular array pixel . The java.awt.image.BufferedImage class , extend Image class allow application operate directly image data ( example , retrieve set pixel color ) . Applications directly construct instance class . The BufferedImage class cornerstone Java 2D immediate-mode imaging API . It manage image memory provide method store , interpreting , obtain pixel data . Since BufferedImage subclass Image render Graphics Graphics2D method accept Image parameter . A BufferedImage essentially Image accessible data buffer . It therefore efficient work directly BufferedImage . A BufferedImage ColorModel Raster image data . The ColorModel provide color interpretation image 's pixel data . The Raster perform following function : Represents rectangular coordinate image Maintains image data memory Provides mechanism create multiple subimages single image data buffer Provides method access specific pixel within image The basic operation image represent following section : Reading/Loading image This section explain load image external image format Java application use Image I/O API Drawing image This section teach display image use drawImage method Graphics Graphics2D class . Creating draw To image This section describe create image use image draw surface . Writing/saving image This section explain save create image appropriate format .
