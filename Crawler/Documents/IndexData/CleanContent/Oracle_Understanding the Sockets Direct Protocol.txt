For high performance compute environment , capacity move data across network quickly efficiently requirement . Such network typically describe require high throughput low latency . High throughput refers environment deliver large amount processing capacity long period time . Low latency refers minimal delay process input provide output , would expect real-time application . In environment , conventional networking use socket stream create bottleneck come move data . Introduced 1999 InfiniBand Trade Association , InfiniBand ( IB ) create address need high performance computing . One important feature IB Remote Direct Memory Access ( RDMA ) . RDMA enable move data directly memory one computer another computer , bypass operating system computer result significant performance gain . The Sockets Direct Protocol ( SDP ) networking protocol develop support stream connection InfiniBand fabric . SDP support introduce JDK 7 release Java Platform , Standard Edition ( `` Java SE Platform '' ) application deploy Solaris Operating System ( `` Solaris OS '' ) Linux operate system . The Solaris OS support SDP InfiniBand since Solaris 10 5/08 . On Linux , InfiniBand package call OFED ( OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution ) . The JDK 7 release support 1.4.2 1.5 version OFED .
