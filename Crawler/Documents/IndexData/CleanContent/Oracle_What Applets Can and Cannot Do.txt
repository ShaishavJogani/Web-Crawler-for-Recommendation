Java applet load client user visit page contain applet . The security model behind Java applet design goal protect user malicious applet . Applets either sandbox applet privilege applet . Sandbox applet run security sandbox allow set safe operation . Privileged applet run outside security sandbox extensive capability access client . Applets sign restrict security sandbox , run user accept applet . Applets sign certificate recognize certificate authority either run sandbox , request permission run outside sandbox . In either case , user must accept applet 's security certificate , otherwise applet block run . It recommend launch applet use Java Network Launch Protocol ( JNLP ) leverage expanded capability improve user experience . See Deploying Applet step step instruction applet deployment . It recommend deploy applet web server , even test . To run applet locally , add applet exception site list , manage Security tab Java Control Panel . In topic discuss security restriction capability applet . Sandbox Applets Sandbox applet restrict security sandbox perform following operation : They make network connection host port come . Protocols must match , domain name use load applet , domain name must use connect back host , IP address . They easily display HTML document use showDocument method java.applet.AppletContext class . They invoke public method applet page . Applets load local file system ( directory user 's CLASSPATH ) none restriction applet load network . They read secure system property . See System Properties list secure system property . When launch use JNLP , sandbox applet also perform following operation : They open , read , save file client . They access share system-wide clipboard . They access print function . They store data client , decide applet download cache , much . See JNLP API information develop applet use JNLP API . Sandbox applet perform following operation : They access client resource local filesystem , executable file , system clipboard , printer . They connect retrieve resource third party server ( server server originate ) . They load native library . They change SecurityManager . They create ClassLoader . They read certain system property . See System Properties list forbidden system property . Privileged applet Privileged applet security restriction impose sandbox applet run outside security sandbox . Note : JavaScript code treat like unsigned code . When privileged applet access JavaScript code HTML page , applet execute within security sandbox . This imply privileged applet essentially behave like sandbox applet . See Security Rich Internet Applications information work applet .
