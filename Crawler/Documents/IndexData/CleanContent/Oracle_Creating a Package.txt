To create package , choose name package ( naming convention discuss next section ) put package statement name top every source file contain type ( class , interface , enumeration , annotation type ) want include package . The package statement ( example , package graphic ; ) must first line source file . There one package statement source file , apply type file . Note : If put multiple type single source file , one public , must name source file . For example , define public class Circle file Circle.java , define public interface Draggable file Draggable.java , define public enum Day file Day.java , forth . You include non-public type file public type ( strongly discourage , unless non-public type small closely relate public type ) , public type accessible outside package . All top-level , non-public type package private . If put graphic interface class list precede section package call graphic , would need six source file , like : //in Draggable.java file package graphic ; public interface Draggable { . . . } //in Graphic.java file package graphic ; public abstract class Graphic { . . . } //in Circle.java file package graphic ; public class Circle extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } //in Rectangle.java file package graphic ; public class Rectangle extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } //in Point.java file package graphic ; public class Point extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } //in Line.java file package graphic ; public class Line extend Graphic implement Draggable { . . . } If use package statement , type end unnamed package . Generally speak , unnamed package small temporary application begin development process . Otherwise , class interface belong name package .
