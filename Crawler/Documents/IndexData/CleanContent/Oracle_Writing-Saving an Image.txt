This lesson start explanation use javax.imageio package , load image external image format internal BufferedImage format use Java 2D . Then explain use Graphics.drawImage ( ) draw image , optional filtering . The final stage save BufferedImage object external image format . This may image originally load Image I/O class external image format perhaps modify use Java 2D APIs , may one create Java 2D . The Image I/O class provide simple way save image variety image format following example : static boolean ImageIO.write ( RenderedImage im , String formatName , File output ) throw IOException Note : The BufferedImage class implement RenderedImage interface . . The formatName parameter select image format save BufferedImage . try { // retrieve image BufferedImage bi = getMyImage ( ) ; File outputfile = new File ( `` saved.png '' ) ; ImageIO.write ( bi , `` png '' , outputfile ) ; } catch ( IOException e ) { ... } The ImageIO.write method call code implement PNG write “ PNG writer plug-in ” . The term plug-in use since Image I/O extensible support wide range format . But following standard image format plugins : JPEG , PNG , GIF , BMP WBMP always present . Each image format advantage disadvantage : Format Plus Minus GIF Supports animation , transparent pixel Supports 256 color translucency PNG Better alternative GIF JPG high colour lossless image , support translucency Does n't support animation JPG Great photographic image Loss compression , good text , screenshots , application original image must preserve exactly For application sufficient use one standard plugins . They advantage readily available . The Image I/O class provide way plug support additional format use , many plug-in exist . If interested file format available load save system , may use getReaderFormatNames getWriterFormatNames method ImageIO class . These method return array string list format support JRE . String writerNames [ ] = ImageIO.getWriterFormatNames ( ) ; The returned array name include additional plug-in instal name may use format name select image writer . The following code example simple version complete image edit/touch program use revised version ImageDrawingApplet.java sample program use follow : An image first loaded via Image I/O The user select filter drop list new updated image draw The user select save format drop list Next file chooser appear user select save image The modify image view desktop application The complete code example represent SaveImage.java . In lesson learn basic Image I/O , provide extensive support write image , include work directly ImageWriter plug-in achieve finer control encoding process . ImageIO write multiple image , image metadata , determine quality vs. size tradeoff . For information see Java Image I/O API Guide .
