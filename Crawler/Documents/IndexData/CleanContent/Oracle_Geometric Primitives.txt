The Java 2D API provide useful set standard shape point , line , rectangle , arc , ellipses , curve . The important package define common geometric primitive java.awt.geom package . Arbitrary shape represent combination straight geometric primitive . The Shape interface represent geometric shape , outline interior . This interface provide common set method describe inspect two-dimensional geometric object support curve line segment multiple sub-shapes . The Graphics class support straight line segment . The Shape interface support curve segment . For detail draw fill shape , see Working Geometry lesson . Points The Point2D class define point represent location ( x , ) coordinate space . The term “ point ” Java 2D API pixel . A point area , contain color , render . Points use create shape . ThePoint2D class also include method calculate distance two point . Lines The Line2D class abstract class represent line . A line ’ coordinate retrieve double . The Line2D class include several method set line ’ endpoint . You also create straight line segment use GeneralPath class describe . Rectangular Shapes The Rectangle2D , RoundRectangle2D , Arc2D , Ellipse2D primitive derive RectangularShape class . This class define method Shape object describe rectangular bounding box . The geometry RectangularShape object extrapolate rectangle completely enclose outline Shape . Quadratic Cubic Curves The QuadCurve2D enable create quadratic parametric curve segment . A quadratic curve define two endpoint one control point . The CubicCurve2D class enable create cubic parametric curve segment . A cubic curve define two endpoint two control point . The following example quadratic cubic curve . See Stroking Filling Graphics Primitivesfor implementation cubic quadratic curve . This figure represent quadratic curve . This figure represent cubic curve . Arbitrary Shapes The GeneralPath class enable construct arbitrary shape specify series position along shape ’ boundary . These position connect line segment , quadratic curve , cubic ( Bézier ) curve . The following shape create three line segment cubic curve . See Stroking Filling Graphics Primitivesfor information implementation shape . Areas With Area class , perform boolean operation , union , intersection , subtraction , two Shape object . This technique , often refer constructive area geometry , enable quickly create complex Shape object without describe line segment curve .
