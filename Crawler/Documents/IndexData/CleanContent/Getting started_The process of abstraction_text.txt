Programming essentially think solution problem real life system . With programming language , need know address real-life problem something could accurately represent within computer system . In order begin program Java programming language ( fact , programming language ) , programmer must first understand basic abstraction . Abstractionis process ofrepresentingreal-life problem object program . Suppose novelist , painter programmer ask toabstract ( i.e. , represent ) real-life object work . Suppose , real-life object need abstract isan animal . Abstraction novelist would include write description animal whilst painter would draw picture animal – computer programmer ? The Java programming language use programming paradigm calledobject-oriented programming ( OOP ) , show exactly programmer need . According OOP , every object problem real-life translate virtual object within computer system . Thinking object [ edit ] In OOP , every abstraction real-life object simply call anobjectwithin code . An object essentially basic representation real-life object part computer system . With Java object-oriented language , everything within Java represent object . To demonstrate effect , define abstraction animal code , would write following line code ( would abstraction ) : The code create space within code startdefiningan object ; space call aclass ( ortype ) definition . All object need define use class definition order use program . Notice curly bracket – anything write within bracket would serve definition specification object . In case example , create class definition calledAnimalfor object could serve abstract representation animal real-life . The way Java environment evaluate code class definition look prefix word use begin class definition ( i.e. , class ) . Such predefined word Java language know askeywordsand make grammar language ( know asprogramming syntax ) . Note : Class definition different name different language . They sometimes calledtype definition , object specificationsortemplatesas well Understanding class definition type [ edit ] Aristotlewas perhaps first person think abstract type typology object . He start call class – e.g. , class bird , class mammal . Class definition therefore serve purpose well define common characteristic type object would create . Upon declare class definition , create object base definition . In order however , need write special syntax go like : The code effectively create object calleddogbased class definition forAnimal . In non-programmer parlance , code would translate something akin say , `` Create new objectdogof typeAnimal . '' A single class definition enable create multiple object code indicates : Basically , write code class type definition , use create countless number object base specification . Although might grasp importance , little exercise save lot time ( luxury readily available programmer pre-Java day ) . Expanding class definition [ edit ] Although object create class definition essentially , way differentiate object code . Object field ( simplyfields ) make object unique object . Let 's take present abstraction instance . An animal could dog , cat , camel duck since abstraction generic kind , need define field common animal yet make animal stand apart . For instance , two field : name ( common name give one animal ) andlegs ( number limbs one animal would require walk ) . As start define object , start look like : In code define two object field : field callednameof typeString ; , field calledlegsof typeint . These special pre-defined type calleddata type . TheStringdata type use field holdtextualvalues like name , theint ( integer ) data type use field holdnumericvalues Note : Fields call different thing different language . They may calledstate identifier , propertiesormember variablesin program language syntax . Java use wordsfieldsandpropertiesin different context , would understand upcoming section . Figure 3 : In order denote theAnimalobject system within Java Environment , present . Note field present . In order demonstrate fields work , go ahead create object amend version class definition : You access field create object use . ( dot ) ormembership operator . In example , create two object : animal1andanimal2of typeAnimal . And since , establish eachAnimalhas two field namelynameandlegs , access modify field object use membership operator set two apart . By declare different value different object , manipulate currentstate . So , instance : theanimal1object '' dog '' with4legs walk ; , theanimal2object '' duck '' with2legs walk . What set two object apart current state . Both object different state thus stand two different object even though create template class definition . Adding behavior object [ edit ] At point , object nothing declare bunch field . Being system , object ability interact environment system well . To add capability interaction , need add interactive behavior object class definition well . Such behavior add class definition use programming construct calledmethod . In case theAnimal , require virtual representation animal able move environment . Let 's say , analogy , want yourAnimalobject able walk environment . Thus , need add method namedwalkto object . To , need write following code : As write code , one thing become immediately apparent . Just like class description , method curly bracket well . Generally , curly bracket use define area ( orscope ) within object . So first set curly bracket define scope class definition call theclass-level scope . This new set curly bracket alongside method define scope definition method call themethod-level scope . In instance , name method iswalk . Notice however name method also feature set round bracket well . More visual identifier method , round bracket use provide method additional input information calledarguments . A method therefore enable object : Accept input : Receive argument ( ) ; Process information : work receive argument ( ) within curly bracket ; , Generate ouput : occasionally , return something back . In essence , method make object behave like system . Notice keywordvoidbefore name method – tell u methodwalkreturnsnothing . You set method return data type – aStringor anintas well . Note : Methods know different name different programming language . They might calledfunctions , procedure , routinesorbehaviors . Figure 4 : TheAnimalobject denote interaction behavior within Java Environmentas illustrate . Note difference presentation field method .
