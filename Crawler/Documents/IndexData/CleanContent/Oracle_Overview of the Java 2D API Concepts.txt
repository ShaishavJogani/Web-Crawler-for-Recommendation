The Java 2D API provide two-dimensional graphic , text , image capability Java program extension Abstract Windowing Toolkit ( AWT ) . This comprehensive rendering package support line art , text , image flexible , full-featured framework develop rich user interface , sophisticated drawing program , image editor . Java 2D object exist plane call user coordinate space , user space . When object render screen printer , user space coordinate transform device space coordinate . The following link useful start learn Java 2D API : Graphics class Graphics2D class The Java 2D API provide follow capability : A uniform rendering model display device printer A wide range geometric primitive , curve , rectangle , ellipsis , well mechanism render virtually geometric shape Mechanisms perform hit detection shape , text , image A compositing model provide control overlapping object render Enhanced color support facilitate color management Support print complex document Control quality rendering use render hint These topic discuss following section : Java 2D Rendering Geometric Primitives Text Images Printing
