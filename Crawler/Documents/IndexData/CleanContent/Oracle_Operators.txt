Now 've learn declare initialize variable , probably want know something . Learning operator Java programming language good place start . Operators special symbol perform specific operation one , two , three operand , return result . As explore operator Java programming language , may helpful know ahead time operator high precedence . The operator following table list accord precedence order . The closer top table operator appear , high precedence . Operators high precedence evaluate operator relatively low precedence . Operators line equal precedence . When operator equal precedence appear expression , rule must govern evaluate first . All binary operator except assignment operator evaluate leave right ; assignment operator evaluate right leave .
