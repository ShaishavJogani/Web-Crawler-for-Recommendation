Identifying Locale-Specific Objects If application user interface , contain many locale-specific object . To get start , go source code look object vary Locale . Your list might include object instantiate following class : String Image Color AudioClip You 'll notice list n't contain object represent number , date , time , currency . The display format object varies Locale , object . For example , format Date accord Locale , use Date object regardless Locale . Instead isolate object ResourceBundle , format special locale-sensitive formatting class . You 'll learn Dates Times section Formatting lesson . In general , object store ResourceBundle predefined ship product . These object modify program run . For instance , store Menu label ResourceBundle locale-specific change program session . However , isolate ResourceBundle String object end user enters TextField . Data String may vary day day . It specific program session , Locale program run . Usually object need isolate ResourceBundle String object . However , String object locale-specific . For example , String protocol element use interprocess communication , n't need localize , end user never see . The decision whether localize String object always clear . Log file good example . If log file write one program read another , program use log file buffer communication . Suppose end user occasionally check content log file . Should n't log file localize ? On hand , end user rarely check log file , cost translation may worthwhile . Your decision localize log file depend number factor : program design , ease use , cost translation , supportability . Organizing ResourceBundle Objects You organize ResourceBundle object accord category object contain . For example , might want load GUI label order entry window ResourceBundle call OrderLabelsBundle . Using multiple ResourceBundle object offer several advantage : Your code easy read maintain . You 'll avoid huge ResourceBundle object , may take long load memory . You reduce memory usage load ResourceBundle need .
