The precede exception could create explicitly developer case following code : Note whenbequals zero , return value . Instead ajava.lang.ArithmeticExceptiongenerated Java interpreter , exception create coder . The result . It show exception object . Its main particularity throw . An exception object must inherit fromjava.lang.Exception . Standard exception two constructor : The default constructor ; , A constructor take string argument place pertinent information exception . This string later extract use various method , see thecode listing 6.2 . You throw type ofThrowableobject use keywordthrow . It interrupt method . Anything thethrowstatement would execute , unless thethrownexception ishandled . The exception object notreturnedfrom method , isthrownfrom method . That mean exception object return value method call method interrupt ... Typically , 'll throw different class exception different type error .
