With learn far , identify different type sign integer value create manipulate Java . Following table basic numeric type : integer . As discuss earlier , data type Java integer caters positive negative value hence aresigned numeric type . The size bit numeric type determine minimum maximum value would . If doubt , one always calculate value . Lets see new find knowledge basic integer type Java fit picture . Say , want numerically manipulate day year — 365 day . What type would use ? Since data typebyteonly go 127 , would risk give value great allow maximum . Such decision might save dread error might occur programmed code . A much sensible choice numeric operation might ashort . Oh , could n't make one data type hold kind number ? Would n't ask question ? Well , let 's explore . When tell program need use integer , say even abyte , Java program allocate space memory . It allocate whole 8 bit memory . Where would n't seem matter today 's memory module place almost dozen trillion bit , matter case . Once allocate part memory get use claim back operation finish . Consider complicated Java program data type 'd use would belongintegers . What happen 's space memory allocation job ? Ever heard theStack Overflow error . That 's exactly happen — memory get completely use fast . So , choose data type extreme caution . Enough talk , let 's see create numeric type . A numeric type begin type 's name ( short , int , etc . ) provide name allocated space memory . Following 's . Say , need create variable hold number day year . Here , daysInYearis name variable holds365as value , whileshortis data type particular value . Other us integer data type Java might see write code give :
