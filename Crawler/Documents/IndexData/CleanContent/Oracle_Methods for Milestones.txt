The Applet class provide framework applet execution , define method system call milestone occur . Milestones major event applet 's life cycle . Most applet override method respond appropriately milestone . init Method The init method useful one-time initialization n't take long . The init method typically contain code would normally put constructor . The reason applet n't usually constructor n't guarantee full environment init method call . Keep init method short applet load quickly . start Method Every applet perform task initialization ( except direct response user action ) must override start method . The start method start execution applet . It good practice return quickly start method . If need perform computationally intensive operation might good start new thread purpose . stop Method Most applet override start also override stop method . The stop method suspend applet 's execution , n't take system resource user n't view applet 's page . For example , applet display animation stop try draw animation user n't view . destroy Method Many applet n't need override destroy method stop method ( call destroy ) perform task necessary shut applet 's execution . However , destroy method available applet need release additional resource . Note : Keep implementation destroy method short possible , guarantee method completely execute . The Java Virtual Machine might exit long destroy method complete .
