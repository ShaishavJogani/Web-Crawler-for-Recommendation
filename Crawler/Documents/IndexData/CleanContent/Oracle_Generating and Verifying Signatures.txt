This lesson walk step necessary use JDK Security API generate digital signature data verify signature authentic . This lesson mean developer wish incorporate security functionality program , include cryptography service . This lesson demonstrate use JDK Security API respect sign document . The lesson show one program , execute person original document , would generate key , generate digital signature document use private key , export public key signature file . Then show example another program , execute receiver document , signature , public key . It show program could import public key verify authenticity signature . The lesson also discuss demonstrate possible alternative approach method supply import key , include certificate . For information concept terminology ( digital signature , certificate , keystores ) , see API Tools Use Secure Code File Exchanges lesson . In lesson create two basic application , one digital signature generation verification . This follow discussion demonstration potential enhancement . The lesson contain three section . Generating Digital Signature show use API generate key digital signature data use private key export public key signature file . The application get data file name command line . Verifying Digital Signature show use API import public key signature allege signature specify data file verify authenticity signature . The data , public key , signature file name specify command line . Weaknesses Alternatives discus potential weakness approach use basic program . It present demonstrate possible alternative approach method supply import key , include use file contain encode key byte use certificate contain public key .
