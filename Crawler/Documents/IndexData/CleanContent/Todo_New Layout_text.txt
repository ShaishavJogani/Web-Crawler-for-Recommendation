I 'm go crack suggest possible outline book . Introduction/Preface- Contains introduction material book , include mention contributor style convention use throughout.Setup- Start prepare user ' computer , instal JDK explain technology Java , I 'd like see mention operate system Unix Unix Like system see Java design cross platform language.Beginner- basic program flow , get user use syntax Java , maybe treat chapter introduction program general , give introduction object orientated programming.Intermediate- could good starting point people program , switch Java , talk various core aspect feature API.Advance- Revisiting topic mention , great depth . Talking thing like RMI , Corba.IndexAppendix- Keywords , reference , bibliography stuff worth mentioningSkill order ( Beginner , Intermediate Advanced ) good idea well follow order implicitly rather explicitly . Cutting book three part n't follow topic make sense . The topic naturally list basic advanced concept . So theBeginner , IntermediateandAdvancedtopics replace byLanguage fundamental , Classes object , Collections , Exceptions , Concurrent Programming , Javadoc & Annotations , Byte Code.Ftiercel ( discussâ€¢contribs ) 21:49 , 5 November 2012 ( UTC )
