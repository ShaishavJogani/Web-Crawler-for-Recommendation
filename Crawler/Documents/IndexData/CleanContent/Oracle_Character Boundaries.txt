You need locate character boundary application allow end user highlight individual character move cursor text one character time . To create BreakIterator locate character boundary , invoke getCharacterInstance method , follow : BreakIterator characterIterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance ( currentLocale ) ; This type BreakIterator detect boundary user character , Unicode character . A user character may compose one Unicode character . For example , user character ü compose combine Unicode character \u0075 ( u ) \u00a8 ( ¨ ) . This n't best example , however , character ü may also represent single Unicode character \u00fc . We 'll draw Arabic language realistic example . In Arabic word house : This word contain three user character , compose following six Unicode character : String house = `` \u0628 '' + `` \u064e '' + `` \u064a '' + `` \u0652 '' + `` \u067a '' + `` \u064f '' ; The Unicode character position 1 , 3 , 5 house string diacritic . Arabic require diacritic alter meaning word . The diacritic example nonspacing character , since appear base character . In Arabic word processor move cursor screen every Unicode character string . Instead must move every user character , may compose one Unicode character . Therefore must use BreakIterator scan user character string . The sample program BreakIteratorDemo , create BreakIterator scan Arabic character . The program pass BreakIterator , along String object create previously , method name listPositions : BreakIterator arCharIterator = BreakIterator.getCharacterInstance ( new Locale ( `` ar '' , '' SA '' ) ) ; listPositions ( house , arCharIterator ) ; The listPositions method use BreakIterator locate character boundary string . Note BreakIteratorDemo assign particular string BreakIterator setText method . The program retrieve first character boundary first method invoke next method constant BreakIterator.DONE return . The code routine follow : static void listPositions ( String target , BreakIterator iterator ) { iterator.setText ( target ) ; int boundary = iterator.first ( ) ; ( boundary ! = BreakIterator.DONE ) { System.out.println ( boundary ) ; boundary = iterator.next ( ) ; } } The listPositions method print follow boundary position user character string house . Note position diacritic ( 1 , 3 , 5 ) list : 0 2 4 6
