One advantage provide self-contained application user ability set file association . Specific type file associate application base MIME type file extension application use open associate file . For example , application edit text file , set file association run application user double-clicks file extension .txt . The File Association Demo read JavaScript Groovy code . Using MIME type file extension , application associate JavaScript Groovy file . You download source file File Association Demo Self-Contained Application Examples . Setting Up File Associations The Ant task generate self-contained application bundle build.xml file File Association Demo . The < fx : association > Ant element use associate file extension MIME type application . Linux bundlers require MIME type , Windows bundlers require file extension , OS X bundlers require least one property . It good practice use property one-to-one mapping MIME type file extension , enable use build file multiple platform . See < fx : association > information element . The following code show need include fx : deploy element associate application extension .js .groovy MIME type text/javascript text/x-groovy . < fx : info title= '' File Association Demo '' vendor= '' MySamples '' description= '' A Demo File Associations Java Packager '' category= '' Demos '' license= '' 3 Clause BSD '' > < fx : association extension= '' j '' mimetype= '' text/javascript '' description= '' JavaScript Source '' / > < fx : association extension= '' groovy '' mimetype= '' text/x-groovy '' description= '' Groovy Source '' / > < /fx : info > If bundler support file association , association ignore . As 8u40 release JDK , Windows EXE MSI bundlers , Linux DEB RPM bundlers , Mac .app bundler support file association . The OS X PKG DMG bundlers support file association use Mac .app bundler . See build.xml complete build code . To generate installable bundle File Association Demo , see `` Generating Bundles '' section Converting Existing Application . Launching Associated Files File association set installer self-contained application bundle instal user 's system . After application instal , open file associate application cause application start . The action take launch application depend platform run . Launching Linux Windows On Linux Windows , application launch base file association , file open pass argument main class , override default argument class . For File Associations Demo , argument pass loadscript method instance application start . A different instance application start file open . See ScriptRunnerApplication.java Linux Windows version code . Launching OS X On OS X , single instance application run . When associate file open , event send application . The application must event listener register handle event . The File Association Demo OS X subclass different main method version Linux Windows . This main method handle default argument way main method Linux Windows version , register listener OS X FileOpenHandler . The event method listener call associate file open , file name extract getFiles method OpenFilesEvent object . See ScriptRunnerApplicationMac.java OS X version code . Building OS X version File Association Demo require access OS X-specific class come Oracle JDK . Most com.apple.eawt class include symbol file javac compiler use . To tell compiler ignore symbol file , -XDignore.symbol.file=true argument pass javac compiler -pre-init Ant task build file . See build.xml . More About File Association Demo The project File Association Demo contain Java source file application /src/sample/fa directory . Custom icon provide /src/package/platform directory . Sample file package application /src directory . To handle Groovy code , File Association Demo require Groovy library . The build process download Groovy library /lib directory . See Adding External Library information . After JAR file generate , build process copy /src /lib directory /dist directory . The /dist directory contain file application . The File Association Demo take file name argument . If application start open associate file , name associate file pass . If application start directly , sample file sample.js , bundle application , pass . See Providing Default Argument information . Admin privilege require set file association . By default EXE installer Windows request admin privilege . To force request admin privilege File Association Demo , bundle argument win.exe.systemWide set true . This setting indicate system-wide installation perform , require admin privilege . The File Association Demo run Linux , OS X , Windows . The demo set use single build file contain information platform . See Using Common Build File All Platforms information .
