The Java Remote Method Invocation ( RMI ) system allow object running one Java virtual machine invoke method object running another Java virtual machine . RMI provide remote communication program write Java programming language . Note : If connect exist IDL program , use Java IDL rather RMI . This trail provide brief overview RMI system walk complete client/server example use RMI 's unique capability load execute user-defined task runtime . The server example implement generic compute engine , client use compute value . An Overview RMI Applications describe RMI system list advantage . Additionally , section provide description typical RMI application , compose server client , introduces important term . Writing RMI Server walk code compute engine server . This section teach design implement RMI server . Creating A Client Program take look one possible compute engine client use illustrate important feature RMI client . Compiling Running Example show compile run compute engine server client .
