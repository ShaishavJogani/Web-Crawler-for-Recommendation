Uses Reflection Reflection commonly use program require ability examine modify runtime behavior application run Java virtual machine . This relatively advanced feature use developer strong grasp fundamental language . With caveat mind , reflection powerful technique enable application perform operation would otherwise impossible . Extensibility Features An application may make use external , user-defined class create instance extensibility object use fully-qualified name . Class Browsers Visual Development Environments A class browser need able enumerate member class . Visual development environment benefit make use type information available reflection aid developer write correct code . Debuggers Test Tools Debuggers need able examine private member class . Test harness make use reflection systematically call discoverable set APIs define class , insure high level code coverage test suite . Drawbacks Reflection Reflection powerful , use indiscriminately . If possible perform operation without use reflection , preferable avoid use . The following concern keep mind access code via reflection . Performance Overhead Because reflection involve type dynamically resolve , certain Java virtual machine optimization perform . Consequently , reflective operation slow performance non-reflective counterpart , avoid section code call frequently performance-sensitive application . Security Restrictions Reflection require runtime permission may present run security manager . This important consideration code run restricted security context , Applet . Exposure Internals Since reflection allow code perform operation would illegal non-reflective code , access private field method , use reflection result unexpected side-effects , may render code dysfunctional may destroy portability . Reflective code break abstraction therefore may change behavior upgrade platform . Trail Lessons This trail cover common us reflection access manipulate class , field , method , constructor . Each lesson contain code example , tip , troubleshoot information . Classes This lesson show various way obtain Class object use examine property class , include declaration content . Members This lesson describe use Reflection APIs find field , method , constructor class . Examples provide set get field value , invoke method , create new instance object use specific constructor . Arrays Enumerated Types This lesson introduce two special type class : array , generate runtime , enum type , define unique name object instance . Sample code show retrieve component type array set get field array enum type . Note : The example trail design experiment Reflection APIs . The handling exception therefore would use production code . In particular , production code recommend dump stack trace visible user .
