Before catch exception , code somewhere must throw one . Any code throw exception : code , code package write someone else package come Java platform , Java runtime environment . Regardless throw exception , 's always throw throw statement . As probably notice , Java platform provide numerous exception class . All class descendant Throwable class , allow program differentiate among various type exception occur execution program . You also create exception class represent problem occur within class write . In fact , package developer , might create set exception class allow user differentiate error occur package error occur Java platform package . You also create chained exception . For information , see Chained Exceptions section . The throw Statement All method use throw statement throw exception . The throw statement require single argument : throwable object . Throwable object instance subclass Throwable class . Here 's example throw statement . throw someThrowableObject ; Let 's look throw statement context . The following pop method take class implement common stack object . The method remove top element stack return object . public Object pop ( ) { Object obj ; ( size == 0 ) { throw new EmptyStackException ( ) ; } obj = objectAt ( size - 1 ) ; setObjectAt ( size - 1 , null ) ; size -- ; return obj ; } The pop method check see whether element stack . If stack empty ( size equal 0 ) , pop instantiate new EmptyStackException object ( member java.util ) throw . The Creating Exception Classes section chapter explain create exception class . For , need remember throw object inherit java.lang.Throwable class . Note declaration pop method contain throw clause . EmptyStackException checked exception , pop require state might occur . Throwable Class Its Subclasses The object inherit Throwable class include direct descendant ( object inherit directly Throwable class ) indirect descendant ( object inherit child grandchild Throwable class ) . The figure illustrate class hierarchy Throwable class significant subclass . As see , Throwable two direct descendant : Error Exception .
