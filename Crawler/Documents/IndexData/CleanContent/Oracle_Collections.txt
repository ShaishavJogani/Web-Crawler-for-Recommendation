This section describe Java Collections Framework . Here , learn collection make job easy program well . You 'll learn core element — interface , implementation , aggregate operation , algorithms — comprise Java Collections Framework . Introduction tell collection , 'll make job easy program well . You 'll learn core element comprise Collections Framework : interface , implementation algorithm . Interfaces describe core collection interface , heart soul Java Collections Framework . You 'll learn general guideline effective use interface , include use interface . You 'll also learn idiom interface help get interface . Aggregate Operations iterate collection behalf , enable write concise efficient code process element store collection . Implementations describe JDK 's general-purpose collection implementation tell use implementation . You 'll also learn wrapper implementation , add functionality general-purpose implementation . Algorithms describe polymorphic algorithm provide JDK operate collection . With luck 'll never write sort routine ! Custom Implementations tell might want write collection implementation ( instead use one general-purpose implementation provide JDK ) , 'd go . It 's easy JDK 's abstract collection implementation ! Interoperability tell Collections Framework interoperates old APIs predate addition Collections Java . Also , tell design new APIs 'll interoperate seamlessly new APIs .
