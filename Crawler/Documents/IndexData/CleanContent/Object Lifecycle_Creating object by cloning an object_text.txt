Cloning automatically available class . There help though , Java object inherit theprotected Object clone ( ) method . This base method would allocate memory bit bit copying object 's state . You may ask need clone method . Ca n't create constructor , pas object copying variable variable ? An example would ( note access privatememberVarvariable ofobjis legal class ) : This method work object creation thenewkeyword time-consuming . Theclone ( ) method copy whole object 's memory one operation much faster use new keyword copy variable need create lot object type , performance good create one object clone new one . See factory method return new object use cloning . Now , let 's see make Customer object cloneable . First theCustomerclass need implement theCloneableInterface.Override make theclone ( ) methodpublic , isprotectedin Object class.Call thesuper.clone ( ) method beginning yourclonemethod.Override theclone ( ) method subclass ofCustomer . In thecode listing 4.15we use cloning speed object creation . Another use cloning could take snapshot object change time . Let 's say want store Customer object collection , want disassociate 'live ' object . So add object , clone , original object change point forward , added object wo n't . Also let 's say Customer object reference Activity object contain customer activity . Now face problem , enough clone Customer object , also need clone referenced object . The solution : Make Activity class also cloneableMake sure Activity class 'changeable ' object reference , clone well , see belowChange Customer classclone ( ) method follow : Note mutable object need clone . References unchangeable object String use cloned object without worry .
