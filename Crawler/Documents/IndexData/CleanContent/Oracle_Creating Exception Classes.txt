When face choose type exception throw , either use one write someone else — Java platform provide lot exception class use — write one . You write exception class answer yes following question ; otherwise , probably use someone else 's . Do need exception type n't represent Java platform ? Would help user could differentiate exception throw class write vendor ? Does code throw one related exception ? If use someone else 's exception , user access exception ? A similar question , package independent self-contained ? An Example Suppose write link list class . The class support following method , among others : objectAt ( int n ) — Returns object nth position list . Throws exception argument less 0 number object currently list . firstObject ( ) — Returns first object list . Throws exception list contain object . indexOf ( Object ) — Searches list specified Object return position list . Throws exception object pass method list . The link list class throw multiple exception , would convenient able catch exception throw link list one exception handler . Also , plan distribute linked list package , related code package together . Thus , link list provide set exception class . The next figure illustrate one possible class hierarchy exception throw link list .
