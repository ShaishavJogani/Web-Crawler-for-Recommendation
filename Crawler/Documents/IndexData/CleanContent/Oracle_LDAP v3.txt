Internationalization Internationalization address via international character set ( ISO 10646 ) represent protocol element string ( DNs ) . Version 3 also differs version 2 use UTF-8 encode string . Authentication In addition anonymous , simple ( clear-text password ) authentication , LDAP v3 use Simple Authentication Security Layer ( SASL ) authentication framework ( RFC 2222 ) allow different authentication mechanism use LDAP . SASL specify challenge-response protocol data exchange client server purpose authentication . Several SASL mechanism currently define : DIGEST-MD5 , CRAM-MD5 , Anonymous , External , S/Key , GSSAPI , Kerberos v4 . An LDAP v3 client use SASL mechanism , provide LDAP v3 server support . Moreover , new ( yet-to-be define ) SASL mechanism use without change LDAP make . Referrals A referral information server send back client indicate requested information find another location ( possibly another server ) . In LDAP v2 , server suppose handle referral return client . This handle referral complicate therefore would result more-complicated client . As server build deploy , referral find useful , many server support server-side referral handling . So way find retrofit protocol allow return referral . This place referral inside error message `` partial result '' error response . The LDAP v3 explicit support referral allow server return referral directly client . Referrals wo n't cover lesson always refer JNDI Tutorial manage referral application . Deployment A common protocol LDAP useful ensure directory client server `` speak language . '' When many different directory client application directory server deploy network , also useful entity talk object . A directory schema specifies , among thing , type object directory may mandatory optional attribute type object may . The LDAP v3 define schema ( RFC 2252 RFC 2256 ) base X.500 standard common object find network , country , locality , organization , users/persons , group , device . It also define way client application access server 's schema find type object attribute particular server support . The LDAP v3 far define set syntax represent attribute value ( RFC 2252 ) . For write Java Applications need access schema please refer JNDI Tutorial . Extensions In addition repertoire predefined operation , `` search '' `` modify , '' LDAP v3 define `` extended '' operation . The `` extended '' operation take request argument return response . The request contain identifier identify request argument request . The response contain result perform request . The pair `` extended '' operation request/response call extension . For example , extension Start TLS , request client server activate Start TLS protocol . These extension standard ( define LDAP community ) proprietary ( define particular directory vendor ) . For write application need use Extensions refer JNDI Tutorial . Controls Another way add new feature use control . The LDAP v3 allow behavior operation modify use control . Any number control may send along operation , number control may return result . For example , send Sort control along `` search '' operation tell server sort result search accord `` name '' attribute . Like extension , control standard proprietary . The standard control provide platform . For write application need use control refer JNDI Tutorial .
