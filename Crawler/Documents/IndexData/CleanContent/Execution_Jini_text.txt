After J2EE Sun vision next step network computing . That isJini . The main idea network environment , would many independent service consumer . Jini would allow services/consumers interact dynamically robust way . The basic feature Jini : No user interventionis need service bring offline . ( In contrast EJBs client program know server port number EJB deploy , Jini client issupposed find , discover , service network . ) Self healingby adapt service ( consumer service ) come go . ( Services periodically need renew lease indicate still available . ) Consumers JINI service need prior knowledge service 's implementation . Theimplementation download dynamicallyand run consumer JVM , without configuration user intervention . ( For example , end user may present slightly different user interface depend upon service use time . The implementation user interface code would provide service use . ) A minimal Jini network environment consist : One moreservicesAlookup-servicekeeping list registered servicesOne moreconsumers Jini widely use current writing ( 2006 ) . There two possible reason . One Jini bit complicate understand set . The reason Microsoft pull Java , cause industry turn use proprietary solution .
