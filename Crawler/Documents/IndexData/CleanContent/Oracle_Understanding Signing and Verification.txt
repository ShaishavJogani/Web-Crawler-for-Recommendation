The Java™ platform enable digitally sign JAR file . You digitally sign file reason might sign paper document pen ink -- let reader know write document , least document approval . When sign letter , example , everyone recognize signature confirm write letter . Similarly digitally sign file , anyone `` recognize '' digital signature know file come . The process `` recognize '' electronic signature call verification . When JAR file sign , also option time stamp signature . Similar put date paper document , time stamp signature identify JAR file sign . The time stamp use verify certificate use sign JAR file valid time signing . The ability sign verify file important part Java platform 's security architecture . Security control security policy 's force runtime . You configure policy grant security privilege applet application . For example , could grant permission applet perform normally forbidden operation reading write local file run local executable program . If download code 's sign trusted entity , use fact criterion decide security permission assign code . Once ( browser ) verify applet trust source , platform relax security restriction let applet perform operation would ordinarily forbidden . A trusted applet freedom specify policy file force . The Java platform enable sign verification use special number call public private key . Public key private key come pair , play complementary role . The private key electronic `` pen '' sign file . As name implies , private key know one else `` forge '' signature . A file sign private key verify corresponding public key . Public private key alone , however , n't enough truly verify signature . Even 've verify sign file contain matching key pair , still need way confirm public key actually come signer purport come . One element , therefore , require make signing verification work . That additional element certificate signer include signed JAR file . A certificate digitally sign statement recognize certification authority indicate particular public key . Certification authority entity ( typically firm specialize digital security ) trust throughout industry sign issue certificate key owner . In case sign JAR file , certificate indicate public key contain JAR file . When sign JAR file public key place inside archive along associated certificate 's easily available use anyone want verify signature . To summarize digital signing : The signer sign JAR file use private key . The corresponding public key place JAR file , together certificate , available use anyone want verify signature . Digests Signature File When sign JAR file , file archive give digest entry archive 's manifest . Here 's example entry might look like : Name : test/classes/ClassOne.class SHA1-Digest : TD1GZt8G11dXY2p4olSZPc5Rj64= The digest value hash encoded representation content file time signing . A file 's digest change file change . When JAR file sign , signature file automatically generate place JAR file 's META-INF directory , directory contain archive 's manifest . Signature file filenames .SF extension . Here example content signature file : Signature-Version : 1.0 SHA1-Digest-Manifest : h1yS+K9T7DyHtZrtI+LxvgqaMYM= Created-By : 1.7.0_06 ( Oracle Corporation ) Name : test/classes/ClassOne.class SHA1-Digest : fcav7ShIG6i86xPepmitOVo4vWY= Name : test/classes/ClassTwo.class SHA1-Digest : xrQem9snnPhLySDiZyclMlsFdtM= Name : test/images/ImageOne.gif SHA1-Digest : kdHbE7kL9ZHLgK7akHttYV4XIa0= Name : test/images/ImageTwo.gif SHA1-Digest : mF0D5zpk68R4oaxEqoS9Q7nhm60= As see , signature file contain digest entry archive 's file look similar digest-value entry manifest . However , digest value manifest compute file , digest value signature file compute correspond entry manifest . Signature file also contain digest value entire manifest ( see SHA1-Digest-Manifest header example ) . When sign JAR file verify , digest file re-computed compare digest record manifest ensure content JAR file n't change since sign . As additional check , digest value manifest file re-computed compare value record signature file . You read additional information signature file Manifest Format page JDK™ documentation . The Signature Block File In addition signature file , signature block file automatically place META-INF directory JAR file sign . Unlike manifest file signature file , signature block file human-readable . The signature block file contain two element essential verification : The digital signature JAR file generate signer 's private key The certificate contain signer 's public key , use anyone want verify signed JAR file Signature block filename typically .DSA extension indicate create default Digital Signature Algorithm . Other filename extension possible key associate standard algorithm use signing .
