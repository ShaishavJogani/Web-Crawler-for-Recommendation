If object different class common superclass , ca n't call method class , even two class implement method signature . The solution write interface define method implement two class theSimpleInterfacein theCode list 4.14and class implement interface theCode listing 4.15 . You also implement use common super class class inherit one super class whereas implement several interface . Java support full orthogonal multiple inheritance ( i.e . Java allow create subclass two class ) . Multiple inheritance inC++has complicate rule disambiguate field method inherit multiple superclass type inherit multiple time . By separate interface implementation , interfaces offer much benefit multiple inheritance less complexity ambiguity . The price multiple inheritance code redundancy ; since interface define signature class contain implementation , every class inherit interface must provide implementation defined method , unlike pure multiple inheritance , implementation also inherit . The major benefit Java object common ancestor ( class calledObject ) . When override method define interface several rule follow : Checked exception declare implementation method one declare interface method subclass declare interface method.The signature interface method return type subtype maintain implement methods.All method interface need define class , unless class implement interface abstract .
