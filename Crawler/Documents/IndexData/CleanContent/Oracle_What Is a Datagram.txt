Clients server communicate via reliable channel , TCP socket , dedicate point-to-point channel , least illusion one . To communicate , establish connection , transmit data , close connection . All data send channel receive order send . This guarantee channel . In contrast , application communicate via datagrams send receive completely independent packet information . These client server need dedicated point-to-point channel . The delivery datagrams destination guarantee . Nor order arrival . Definition : A datagram independent , self-contained message send network whose arrival , arrival time , content guarantee . The java.net package contain three class help write Java program use datagrams send receive packet network : DatagramSocket , DatagramPacket , MulticastSocketAn application send receive DatagramPackets DatagramSocket . In addition , DatagramPackets broadcast multiple recipient listen MulticastSocket .
