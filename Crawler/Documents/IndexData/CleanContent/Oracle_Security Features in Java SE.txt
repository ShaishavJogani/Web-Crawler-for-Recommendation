In trail 'll learn built-in Java™ security feature protect malevolent program . You 'll see use tool control access resource , generate check digital signature , create manage key need signature generation checking . You 'll also see incorporate cryptography service , digital signature generation checking , program . The security feature provide Java Development Kit ( JDK™ ) intend variety audience : Users run program : Built-in security functionality protect malevolent program ( include virus ) , maintain privacy file information , authenticate identity code provider . You subject application applet security control need . Developers : You use API method incorporate security functionality program , include cryptography service security check . The API framework enable define integrate permission ( control access specific resource ) , cryptography service implementation , security manager implementation , policy implementation . In addition , class provide management public/private key pair public key certificate people trust . Systems administrator , developer , user : JDK tool manage keystore ( database key certificate ) ; generate digital signature JAR file , verify authenticity signature integrity signed content ; create modify policy file define installation 's security policy . Note : For developer want create applet Java Web Start application , see Java Applets security information . Trail Lessons Creating Policy File show resource access control policy file . For late information policy configuration file , see Policy Guide page . Quick Tour Controlling Applications build previous lesson , show resource access , reading write file , permit application run security manager unless explicitly allow permission policy file . API Tools Use Secure Code File Exchanges define digital signature , certificate , keystores discus need . It also review information applicable next three lesson regard step commonly need use tool API generate signature , export/import certificate , . Signing Code Granting It Permissions illustrate use security-related tool . It show step developer would take sign distribute code others run . The lesson also show someone run code ( system administrator ) could add entry policy file grant code permission resource access need . Exchanging Files show use tool one person sign important document , contract , export public key certificate public key correspond private key use sign contract . Then lesson show another person , receive contract , signature , public key certificate , import certificate verify signature . Generating Verifying Signatures walk step step example write Java program use JDK Security API generate key , generate digital signature data use private key , export public key signature file . Then example show write second program , may expect run different person 's computer , import public key verify authenticity signature . Finally , example discuss potential weakness approach use basic program demonstrate possible alternative approach method supply import key , include certificate . Implementing Your Own Permission demonstrate write class define special permission . For More Information JDK security release documentation find Security guide page . This index page list Specifications present detailed information late security feature , include architecture specification , usage guide , API documentation , tool documentation .
