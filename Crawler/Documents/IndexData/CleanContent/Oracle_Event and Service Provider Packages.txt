Event Package The javax.naming.event package contain class interface support event notification name directory service . Event notification describe detail Event Notification trail . Events A NamingEvent represent event generate naming/directory service . The event contain type identify type event . For example , event type categorize affect namespace , `` object add , '' , `` object changed . '' Listeners A NamingListener object listen NamingEvents . Each category event type corresponding type NamingListener . For example , NamespaceChangeListener represent listener interested namespace change event ObjectChangeListener represent listener interested object change event . To receive event notification , listener must register either EventContext EventDirContext . Once register , listener receive event notification corresponding change occur naming/directory service . The detail Event Notification find JNDI Tutorial . Service Provider Package The javax.naming.spi package provide mean developer different naming/directory service provider develop hook implementation corresponding service accessible application use JNDI . Plug-In Architecture The javax.naming.spi package allow different implementation plug dynamically . These implementation include initial context context reach initial context . Java Object Support The javax.naming.spi package support implementors lookup related method return Java object natural intuitive Java programmer . For example , look printer name directory , likely would expect get back printer object operate . This support provide form object factory . This package also provide support reverse . That , implementors Context.bind ( ) relate method accept Java object store object format acceptable underlie naming/directory service . This support provide form state factory . Multiple Naming Systems ( Federation ) JNDI operation allow application supply name span multiple naming system . In process complete operation , one service provider might need interact another service provider , example pass operation continue next naming system . This package provide support different provider cooperate complete JNDI operation . The detail Service Provider mechanism find JNDI Tutorial .
