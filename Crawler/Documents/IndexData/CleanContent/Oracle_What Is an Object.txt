Objects key understand object-oriented technology . Look around right 'll find many example real-world object : dog , desk , television set , bicycle . Real-world object share two characteristic : They state behavior . Dogs state ( name , color , breed , hungry ) behavior ( barking , fetching , wag tail ) . Bicycles also state ( current gear , current pedal cadence , current speed ) behavior ( change gear , change pedal cadence , apply brake ) . Identifying state behavior real-world object great way begin think term object-oriented programming . Take minute right observe real-world object immediate area . For object see , ask two question : `` What possible state object ? '' `` What possible behavior object perform ? '' . Make sure write observation . As , 'll notice real-world object vary complexity ; desktop lamp may two possible state ( ) two possible behavior ( turn , turn ) , desktop radio might additional state ( , , current volume , current station ) behavior ( turn , turn , increase volume , decrease volume , seek , scan , tune ) . You may also notice object , turn , also contain object . These real-world observation translate world object-oriented programming .
