In conventional language like C C++ , programmer make sure memory allocate free . Memory leak become regular nuisance instance programmer manually allocate system 's memory resource . Memory resource buffer specific mode operation optimal performance . Once buffer fill data , need clean use content . If programmer forgets clean his/her code , memory easily overload . Programming C/C++ language become tedious unsafe quirk , program build language prone memory leakage sudden system crash â€” sometimes even harm hardware . Freeing memory particularly important server , since run without stop day . If piece memory free use server keep allocate memory , memory leak take server . In Java , free memory take programmer hand ; Java Virtual Machine keep track used memory . When memory use automatically free . A separate task run background JVM , free unreferenced , unused memory . That task call theGarbage Collector . The Garbage Collector always run . This automatic memory garbage collection feature make easy write robust server side program Java . The thing programmer watch speed object creation . If application create object faster Garbage Collector free , cause memory problem . Depending JVM configure , application either run memory throw theNotEnoughMemoryException , halt give time Garbage Collector job .
