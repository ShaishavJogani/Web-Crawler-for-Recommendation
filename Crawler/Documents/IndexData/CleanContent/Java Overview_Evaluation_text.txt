In people 's opinion , Java technology delivers reasonably well goal . The language , however , without drawback . Java tend high-level similar language ( C++ ) , mean Java language lack feature hardware-specific data type , low-level pointer arbitrary memory address , program method like operator overloading . Although feature frequently abuse misuse programmer , also powerful tool . However , Java technology includesJava Native Interface ( JNI ) , way call native code Java language code . With JNI , still possible use feature . Some programmer also complain lack multiple inheritance , powerful feature several object-oriented language , among others C++ . The Java language separate inheritance type implementation , allow inheritance multiple type definition interface , single inheritance type implementation via class hierarchy . This allow benefit multiple inheritance avoid many danger . In addition , use concrete class , abstract class , well interface , Java language programmer option choose full , partial , zero implementation object type define , thus ensure maximum flexibility application design . There believe certain project , object orientation make work hard instead easy . This particular complaint unique Java language applies object-oriented language well .
