Programming may trivial boring crunch huge number . However , huge chunk code write programming language today , let alone Java , obsessively deal number , churn huge prime number , [ 1 ] calculate cost emission scooter . In 1965 , Gemini Vspace mission escape near-fatal accident cause programming error . [ 2 ] Again 1979 , computer program overestimate ability five nuclear reactor withstand earthquake ; plant shut temporarily . [ 3 ] There one thing common programming error : subject data , compute time error occur , numeric . Out past experience , Java come bundle revised type check numeric data put significant emphasis correctly identify different type . You must recognise importance numeric data come program . Numbers store memory use binary system . The memory like grid cell : Each cell contain abinary digit ( shortened tobit ) , say , zero one : 01100101 Actually , celldoescontain binary digit , one bit roughly equivalent to1and empty cell memory signifies0 . A single binary digit hold two possible value : zero one . Memory stateGives0→01→1 Multiple bit hold together hold multiple permutation — 2 bit hold 4 possible value , 3 hold 8 , . For instance , maximum number 8 bit hold ( 11111111in binary ) is255in decimal system . So , number 0 255 fit within 8 bit . Memory stateGives00000000→000000001→100000010→200000011→3 ... ... 11111111→255 It good , way , host positive number ( unsigned integer ) . They calledunsigned integer . Unsigned integer whole number value positive attribute negative value . For reason , would ask one 8 bit hold information sign number ( positive negative ) . This leave u 7 bit actually count number . The maximum number 7 bit hold ( 1111111 ) is127in decimal system . Positive numbersNegative numbersMemory stateGives00000000→000000001→100000010→200000011→3 ... ... ... 01111111→127Memory stateGives10000000→-12810000001→-12710000010→-12610000011→-125 ... ... ... 11111111→-1 Altogether , use method , 8 bit hold number range from-128to127 ( include zero ) — total 256 number . Not bad pay-off one might presume . The opposite unsigned integer asigned integerthat capability hold positive negative value . But , large number . You would need significantly bit hold large number . That 's Java 's numeric type come play . Java multiple numeric type — size dependent number bit play . In Java , number dealt use data type specially formulate host numeric data . But dive type , must first set concept stone . Just like high school ( even primary school ) , number Java place clearly distinct group system . As 'd already know , number system include group like theintegernumbers ( 0 , 1 , 2 ... ∞ ) ; negative integer ( 0 , -1 , -2 ... -∞ ) evenrealandrationalnumbers ( value Pi , ¾ , 0.333~ , etcetera ) . Java simply tend place number two distinct group , integer ( -∞ ... 0 ... ∞ ) andfloating pointnumbers ( number decimal point fractional representation ) . For moment , would look integer value easy understand work .
