This trail introduce Java 2Dâ„¢ API show display print 2D graphic Java program . The trail intend developer want enrich knowledge Java 2D API , well beginner computer graphic . Almost every section contain relevant example illustrate specific capability . The Java 2D API enables easily perform following task : Draw line , rectangle geometric shape . Fill shape solid color gradient texture . Draw text option fine control font render process . Draw image , optionally apply filter operation . Apply operation compositing transform rendering operation . This chapter also explain less familiar concept compositing . Using 2D Graphics API display complex chart Using image-filtering operation This chapter describe concept draw on-screen off-screen image , well surface printer device . This trail cover common us Java 2D APIs briefly describe advanced feature . Overview Java 2D Graphics API introduce key Java 2D concept describe Java 2D render model . This lesson conceptual lesson trail , enable get deep basic notion class description . Getting start Graphics use developed example show obtain Graphics object use common graphic render task . Working Geometry teach use APIs draw graphic primitive arbitrary shape , apply fancy stroke fill style . Working Text APIs show effectively use text APIs , include create Font object desired attribute , measure text , determine name font available system . Working Images explain create BufferedImage object , perform image-filtering operation , draw image . Printing teach render 2D graphic printer , print complex document , use Print Services . Advanced topic Java 2D explain perform transformation , clip draw region , composite overlap graphic , specify render preference , control render quality .
