The JMX technology also use monitor manage Java virtual machine ( Java VM ) . The Java VM built-in instrumentation enable monitor manage use JMX technology . These built-in management utility often refer out-of-the-box management tool Java VM . To monitor manage different aspect Java VM , Java VM include platform MBean server special MXBeans use management application conform JMX specification . Platform MXBeans Platform MBean Server The platform MXBeans set MXBeans provide Java SE platform monitoring manage Java VM component Java Runtime Environment ( JRE ) . Each platform MXBean encapsulate part Java VM functionality , class-loading system , just-in-time ( JIT ) compilation system , garbage collector , . These MXBeans display interact use monitoring management tool comply JMX specification , enable monitor manage different VM functionality . One monitoring management tool Java SE platform 's JConsole graphical user interface ( GUI ) . The Java SE platform provide standard platform MBean server platform MXBeans register . The platform MBean server also register MBeans wish create . JConsole The Java SE platform include JConsole monitoring management tool , comply JMX specification . JConsole use extensive instrumentation Java VM ( platform MXBeans ) provide information performance resource consumption application run Java platform . Out-of-the-Box Management Action Because standard monitoring management utility implement JMX technology build Java SE platform , see out-of-the-box JMX technology action without write single line JMX API code . You launch Java application monitor use JConsole . Monitoring Application Using JConsole This procedure show monitor Notepad Java application . Under release Java SE platform prior version 6 , application want monitor JConsole need start following option . -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote However , version JConsole provide Java SE 6 platform attach local application support Attach API . In word , application start Java SE 6 HotSpot VM detect automatically JConsole , need start use command-line option . Start Notepad Java application , use following command terminal window : java -jar jdk_home/demo/jfc/Notepad/Notepad.jar Where jdk_home directory Java Development Kit ( JDK ) instal . If run version 6 Java SE platform , need use following command : java -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote -jar jdk_home/demo/jfc/Notepad/Notepad.jar Once Notepad open , different terminal window , start JConsole use following command : jconsole A New Connection dialog box display . In New Connection dialog box , select Notepad.jar Local Process list , click Connect button . JConsole open connects Notepad.jar process . When JConsole open , present overview monitoring management information relate Notepad . For example , view amount heap memory application consume , number thread application currently run , much central procesing unit ( CPU ) capacity application consume . Click different JConsole tab . Each tab present detailed information different area functionality Java VM Notepad run . All information present obtain various JMX technology MXBeans mention trail . All platform MXBeans display MBeans tab . The MBeans tab examine next section trail . To close JConsole , select Connection - > Exit .
