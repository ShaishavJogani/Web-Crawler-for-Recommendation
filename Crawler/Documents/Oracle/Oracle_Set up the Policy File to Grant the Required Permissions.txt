This step uses the Policy Tool utility to open the policy file named examplepolicy created in the 
Creating a Policy File lesson. You will add a new policy entry granting permission for code from the directory where GetProps.class is stored to read the "user.home" and the "java.home" property values, as shown in the following figure.
The steps are as follows.

Open the Policy File
Grant the Required Permissions
Save the Policy File

Note for UNIX Users:Â The instructions illustrate creating the policy file for a Windows system. The steps are exactly the same if you are working on a UNIX system, with the following differences.

You retrieve the examplepolicy file from the test directory in your home directory.
For the CodeBase URL in the step for granting the required permissions, you can substitute file:${user.home}/test/ for file:/C:/Test/. Alternatively you could directly specify your home directory rather than referring to the "user.home" property, as in file:/home/jones/test/.
