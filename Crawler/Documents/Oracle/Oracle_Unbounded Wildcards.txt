The unbounded wildcard type is specified using the wildcard character (?), for example, List<?>. This is called a list of unknown type. There are two scenarios where an unbounded wildcard is a useful approach:

If you are writing a method that can be implemented using functionality provided in the Object class.
When the code is using methods in the generic class that don't depend on the type parameter.  For example, List.size or List.clear. In fact, Class<?> is so often used because most of the methods in Class<T> do not depend on T.


Consider the following method, printList:

public static void printList(List<Object> list) {
    for (Object elem : list)
        System.out.println(elem + " ");
    System.out.println();
}


The goal of printList is to print a list of any type, but it fails to achieve that goal — it prints only a list of Object instances; it cannot print List<Integer>, List<String>, List<Double>, and so on, because they are not subtypes of List<Object>. To write a generic printList method, use List<?>:

public static void printList(List<?> list) {
    for (Object elem: list)
        System.out.print(elem + " ");
    System.out.println();
}


Because for any concrete type A, List<A> is a subtype of List<?>, you can use printList to print a list of any type:

List<Integer> li = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3);
List<String>  ls = Arrays.asList("one", "two", "three");
printList(li);
printList(ls);

Note: The 
Arrays.asList method is used in examples throughout this lesson.  This static factory method converts the specified array and returns a fixed-size list.


It's important to note that List<Object> and List<?> are not the same. You can insert an Object, or any subtype of Object, into a List<Object>.  But you can only insert null into a List<?>. The
Guidelines for Wildcard Use section has more information on how to determine what kind of wildcard, if any, should be used in a given situation.
