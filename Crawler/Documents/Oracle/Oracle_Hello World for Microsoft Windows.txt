It's time to write your first application! The following instructions are for users of Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. Instructions for other platforms are in 
"Hello World!" for Solaris OS and Linux and 
"Hello World!" for the NetBeans IDE.
If you encounter problems with the instructions on this page, consult the 
Common Problems (and Their Solutions). 

A Checklist
Creating Your First Application

Create a Source File
Compile the Source File into a .class File
Run the Program





 A Checklist  

To write your first program, you'll need:


The Java SE Development Kit 8 (JDK 8)
You can 
download the Windows version now. (Make sure you download the JDK, not the JRE.) Consult the 
installation instructions.


A text editor
In this example, we'll use Notepad, a simple editor included with the Windows platforms. You can easily adapt these instructions if you use a different text editor.


These two items are all you'll need to write your first application.



 Creating Your First Application


Your first application, HelloWorldApp, will simply display the greeting "Hello world!". To create this program, you will: 


Create a source file
A source file contains code, written in the Java programming language, that you and other programmers can understand. You can use any text editor to create and edit source files.


Compile the source file into a .class file
The Java programming language compiler (javac) takes your source file and translates its text into instructions that the Java virtual machine can understand. The instructions contained within this file are known as bytecodes.


Run the program
The Java application launcher tool (java) uses the Java virtual machine to run your application.


 Create a Source File
To create a source file, you have two options:


You can save the file 
HelloWorldApp.java on your computer and avoid a lot of typing. Then, you can go straight to Compile the Source File into a .class File.


Or, you can use the following (longer) instructions.


First, start your editor. You can launch the Notepad editor from the  Start menu by selecting  Programs > Accessories > Notepad. In a new document, type in the following code:

/**
 * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
 * simply prints "Hello World!" to standard output.
 */
class HelloWorldApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.
    }
}

Be Careful When You Type
  

Note: Type all code, commands, and file names exactly as shown. Both the compiler (javac) and launcher (java) are case-sensitive, so you must capitalize consistently.
HelloWorldApp is not the same as helloworldapp.

Save the code in a file with the name HelloWorldApp.java. To do this in Notepad, first choose the  File > Save As menu item. Then, in the  Save As dialog box:

Using the  Save in combo box, specify the folder (directory) where you'll save your file. In this example, the directory is myapplication on the C drive.
In the  File name text field, type "HelloWorldApp.java", including the quotation marks.
From the  Save as type combo box, choose  Text Documents (*.txt).
In the  Encoding combo box, leave the encoding as ANSI.

When you're finished, the dialog box should look like 
this.
