The ButtonGroup component manages the selected/unselected state for a set of buttons. For the group, the ButtonGroup instance guarantees that only one button can be selected at a time.
Initially, all buttons managed by a ButtonGroup instance are unselected.
How to Use ButtonGroup Features
You can use ButtonGroup with any set of objects that inherit from AbstractButton. Typically a button group contains instances of JRadioButton, JRadioButtonMenuItem, or JToggleButton. It would not make sense to put an instance of JButton or JMenuItem in a button group because JButton and JMenuItem do not implement the select/deselect button state.
In general, you will typically follow these steps to write code that uses a ButtonGroup component.

Subclass JFrame
Call ContextPane together with a layout manager
Declare and configure a set of radio buttons or toggle buttons
Instantiate a ButtonGroup object
Call the add method on that buttongroup object in order to add each button to the group.

For details and a code example, see 
How to Use Radio Buttons. It shows how to use a ButtonGroup component to group a set of RadioButtons set into a JPanel.
