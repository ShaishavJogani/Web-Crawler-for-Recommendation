The Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to compile and package your application. The installable bundle must be created on the platform on which the self-contained application will run. For example, if your application runs on Windows and Linux, you must run the packaging tool on Windows to create a .exe or .msi bundle, and run the packaging tool on Linux to create a .rpm or .deb file. 
Third party tools are required to create the installable bundle. The following table identifies the tools for each supported platform.
