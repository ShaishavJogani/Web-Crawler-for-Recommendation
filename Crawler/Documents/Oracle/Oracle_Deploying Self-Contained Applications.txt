A self-contained application consists of a single, installable bundle that contains your application and a copy of the JRE needed to run the application. When the application is installed, it behaves the in the same way as any native application. Providing users with a self-contained application avoids the security issues related to running an application in a browser. 
You can customize a self-contained application by providing your own icons and progress indicator. File associations can be set up so when a user opens a file that your application can handle, your application is started automatically. Multiple entry points are supported so you can deliver a suite of applications in a single self-contained application bundle.
Self-contained applications can be packaged using the Java Packaging tools. The javavpackager command creates the bundle for self-contained applications from the command line. NetBeans can also be used to created self-contained application bundles. This lesson describes how to use Ant tasks to create the bundles.
