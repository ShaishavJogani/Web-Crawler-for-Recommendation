Java technology is both a programming language and a platform.
The Java Programming Language
The Java programming language is a high-level language that can be characterized by all of the following buzzwords:




Simple
Object oriented
Distributed
Multithreaded
Dynamic




Architecture neutral
Portable
High performance
Robust
Secure




Each of the preceding buzzwords is explained in 
The Java Language Environment , a white paper written by James Gosling and Henry McGilton.
In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension. Those source files are then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine1 (Java VM). The java launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.
