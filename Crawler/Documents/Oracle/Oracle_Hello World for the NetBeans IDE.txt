It's time to write your first application! These detailed instructions are for users of the NetBeans IDE. The NetBeans IDE runs on the Java platform, which means that you can use it with any operating system for which there is a JDK available. These operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Solaris OS, Linux, and Mac OS X.


A Checklist
Creating Your First Application

Create an IDE Project
Add JDK 8 to the Platform List (if necessary)
Add Code to the Generated Source File
Compile the Source File
Run the Program

 A ChecklistÂ  

To write your first program, you'll need:


The Java SE Development Kit (JDK 7 has been selected in this example)

For Microsoft Windows, Solaris OS, and Linux: 
Java SE Downloads Index page
For Mac OS X: 
developer.apple.com



The NetBeans IDE

Creating Your First Application
Your first application, HelloWorldApp, will simply display the greeting "Hello World!" To create this program, you will:


Create an IDE project
When you create an IDE project, you create an environment in which to build and run your applications. Using IDE projects eliminates configuration issues normally associated with developing on the command line. You can build or run your application by choosing a single menu item within the IDE.


Add code to the generated source file
A source file contains code, written in the Java programming language, that you and other programmers can understand. As part of creating an IDE project, a skeleton source file will be automatically generated. You will then modify the source file to add the "Hello World!" message.


Compile the source file into a .class file
The IDE invokes the Java programming language compiler (javac), which takes your source file and translates its text into instructions that the Java virtual machine can understand. The instructions contained within this file are known as bytecodes.


Run the program
The IDE invokes the Java application launcher tool (java), which uses the Java virtual machine to run your application.


Create an IDE Project
To create an IDE project:


Launch the NetBeans IDE.


On Microsoft Windows systems, you can use the NetBeans IDE item in the Start menu.


On Solaris OS and Linux systems, you execute the IDE launcher script by navigating to the IDE's bin directory and typing ./netbeans.


On Mac OS X systems, click the NetBeans IDE application icon.




In the NetBeans IDE, choose File | New Project....
