Questions


Consider the following class:

public class IdentifyMyParts {
    public static int x = 7; 
    public int y = 3; 
}



What are the class variables?


What are the instance variables?


What is the output from the following code:

IdentifyMyParts a = new IdentifyMyParts();
IdentifyMyParts b = new IdentifyMyParts();
a.y = 5;
b.y = 6;
a.x = 1;
b.x = 2;
System.out.println("a.y = " + a.y);
System.out.println("b.y = " + b.y);
System.out.println("a.x = " + a.x);
System.out.println("b.x = " + b.x);
System.out.println("IdentifyMyParts.x = " + IdentifyMyParts.x);





Exercises


Write a class whose instances represent a single playing card from a deck of cards. Playing cards have two distinguishing properties: rank and suit. Be sure to keep your solution as you will be asked to rewrite it in Enum Types.
Hint:Â You can use the assert statement to check your assignments. You write:

assert (boolean expression to test); 

If the boolean expression is false, you will get an error message. For example,

assert toString(ACE) == "Ace";

should return true, so there will be no error message.
If you use the assert statement, you must run your program with the ea flag:

java -ea YourProgram.class




Write a class whose instances represent a full deck of cards. You should also keep this solution.


3. Write a small program to test your deck and card classes. The program can be as simple as creating a deck of cards and displaying its cards.
