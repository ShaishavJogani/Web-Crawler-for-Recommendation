Now that the code for the compute engine example has been written, it needs to be compiled and run.
Compiling the Example Programs
In this section, you learn how to compile the server and the client programs that make up the compute engine example.
Running the Example Programs
Finally, you run the server and client programs and consequently compute the value of 
.
