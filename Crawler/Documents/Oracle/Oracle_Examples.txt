CapabilitiesTest demonstrates the different buffering capabilities available for the machine on which it is run.

DisplayModeTest shows a Swing application that uses passive rendering. If full-screen exclusive mode is available, it will enter full-screen exclusive mode. If display mode changes are allowed, it allows you to switch between display modes.

MultiBufferTest enters full-screen mode and uses multi-buffering through an active render loop.
