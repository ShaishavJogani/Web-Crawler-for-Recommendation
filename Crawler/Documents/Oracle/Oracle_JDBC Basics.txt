In this lesson you will learn the basics of the JDBC API.


Getting Started sets up a basic database development environment and shows you how to compile and run the JDBC tutorial samples.


Processing SQL Statements with JDBC outlines the steps required to process any SQL statement. The pages that follow describe these steps in more detail:


Establishing a Connection connects you to your database.


Connecting with DataSource Objects shows you how to connect to your database with DataSource objects, the preferred way of getting a connection to a data source.


Handling SQLExceptions shows you how to handle exceptions caused by database errors.


Setting Up Tables describes all the database tables used in the JDBC tutorial samples and how to create and populate tables with JDBC API and SQL scripts.


Retrieving and Modifying Values from Result Sets develop the process of configuring your database, sending queries, and retrieving data from your database.


Using Prepared Statements describes a more flexible way to create database queries.


Using Transactions shows you how to control when a database query is actually executed.




Using RowSet Objects introduces you to RowSet objects; these are objects that hold tabular data in a way that make it more flexible and easier to use than result sets. The pages that follow describe the different kinds of RowSet objects available:


Using JdbcRowSet Objects


Using CachedRowSetObjets


Using JoinRowSet Objects


Using FilteredRowSet Objects


Using WebRowSet Objects




Using Advanced Data Types introduces you to other data types; the pages that follow describe these data types in further detail:


Using Large Objects


Using SQLXML Objects


Using Array Objects


Using DISTINCT Data Type


Using Structured Objects


Using Customized Type Mappings


Using Datalink Objects


Using RowId Objects




Using Stored Procedures shows you how to create and use a stored procedure, which is a group of SQL statements that can be called like a Java method with variable input and output parameters.


Using JDBC with GUI API demonstrates how to integrate JDBC with the Swing API.
