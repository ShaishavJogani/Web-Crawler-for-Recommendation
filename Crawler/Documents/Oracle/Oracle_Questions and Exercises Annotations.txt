What is wrong with the following interface?

public interface House {
    @Deprecated
    void open();
    void openFrontDoor();
    void openBackDoor();
}



Consider this implementation of the House interface, shown in Question 1.

public class MyHouse implements House {
    public void open() {}
    public void openFrontDoor() {}
    public void openBackDoor() {}
}

If you compile this program, the compiler produces a warning because open was deprecated (in the interface). What can you do to get rid of that warning?


Will the following code compile without error? Why or why not?

public @interface Meal { ... }

@Meal("breakfast", mainDish="cereal")
@Meal("lunch", mainDish="pizza")
@Meal("dinner", mainDish="salad")
public void evaluateDiet() { ... }
