Here, we simulate being, in turn, the HighScore developer (Chris), the ExampleGame developer (Terry), and a user (Kim) running the game.
You can execute all the specified steps, and then (as Kim's last step) run ExampleGame.
The steps are presented without explanation. For further information about the steps that need to be taken by both code signers (such as Chris and Terry) and receivers of such code (such as Kim), see the 
Signing Code and Granting It Permissions lesson.
Here are the steps:

Steps for the HighScore Developer (Chris)
Steps for the ExampleGame Developer (Terry)
Steps for a User Running ExampleGame (Kim)
