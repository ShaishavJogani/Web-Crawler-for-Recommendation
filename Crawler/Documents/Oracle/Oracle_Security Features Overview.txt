Security functions help you to protect your programs and data from harm, to keep data shielded and private, and to deploy new applications in security-aware runtime environments.
Java also provides several tools to help you to manage access to system resources; to create, store and maintain encrypted public and private passwords (key pairs) and certificates; and to create and sign jarfiles during the deployment process.
Note: For a brief overview of security features supported in Java SE 7, see the
Security Overview Whitepaper in the Security Guides directory.
