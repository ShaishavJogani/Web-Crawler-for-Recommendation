Variables

You've already learned that objects store their state in fields. However, the Java 
programming language also uses the term "variable" as well. This section discusses 
this relationship, plus variable naming rules and conventions, 
basic data types (primitive types, character strings, and arrays), default values, and literals.




Operators

This section describes the operators of the Java programming language. It presents the most
commonly-used operators first, and the less commonly-used operators last. Each discussion 
includes code samples that you can compile and run.






Expressions, Statements, and Blocks


  Operators may be used in building expressions, which compute values; expressions are the core components of statements; statements may be grouped into blocks.
 
This section discusses expressions, statements, and blocks using example code that you've already 
seen.



Control Flow Statements

This section describes the control flow statements supported by the Java programming language.
It covers the decisions-making, looping, and branching statements that enable your programs to conditionally
execute particular blocks of code.
