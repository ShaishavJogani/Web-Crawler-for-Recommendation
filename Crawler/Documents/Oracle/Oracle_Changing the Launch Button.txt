You can change your Java Web Start application's Launch button image, if you don't like the default  button or if you have another image that you have standardized on.
Use the deployJava.launchButtonPNG variable to point to the location of your Launch button's image.
Variable: deployJava.launchButtonPNG
Usage: Providing an alternate image URL
In this example, the Notepad application's Launch button is now an image of Duke waving.
          
<script src="https://www.java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
<script>
    deployJava.launchButtonPNG='https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/images/DukeWave.gif';
    var url = "https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorialJWS/deployment/webstart/examples/Notepad.jnlp";
    deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(url, '1.6.0');
</script>

The Notepad application's new Launch button (Duke waving) follows. Click on Duke's image to launch the Notepad application.
