Output Streams direct streams of bytes outwards to the environment from our program or application.OutputStreamis an abstract class which is the destination counterpart ofInputStream.OutputStreamhas awrite()method which can be used to write a byte to the stream.  The method is overloaded, and can take an array as well.  Aclose()method closes the stream when the application is finished with it, and it has aflush()method.  The stream may wait until it has a certain amount before it writes it all at once for efficiency.  If the stream object is buffering any data before writing it, theflush()method will force it to write all of this data.  LikeInputStream, this class cannot be instantiated, but has concrete subclasses that parallel those ofInputStream, egByteArrayOutputStream,FileOutputStream, etc.
In thefollowing example, we store the current time in an already existing file calledlog.txtlocated in the same folder than the class.


This case is more simple as we can put all the data in the stream at the same time. The first part of the code generate a string containing the current time. Then we create aFileobject identifying the output file and an output stream for this file. We write the data in the stream, flush it and close it. That's all. No try/catch block has been defined for readability but the thrown exceptions should be caught.

In order to read a text file several times from the beginning, aFileChannelvariable should be introduced, only to reposition the reader.

Now let's execute it:

LogTime execution$ java LogTime

We should obtain this content:

Code listing 9.4: log.txtMon Oct 15 14:24:40 CEUTC 2018

If it shows aFileNotFoundExceptionor anIOException, the file should not have been created or it is not placed in the right folder.

There is alsoWriterwhich is a character counterpart ofOutputStream, and a destination counterpart to Reader, this is also an abstract superclass.  Particular implementations parallel those of Reader, egFileWriter,StringWriter, andOutputStreamWriter, for converting a regularOutputStreaminto a reader so that it can take character data.
