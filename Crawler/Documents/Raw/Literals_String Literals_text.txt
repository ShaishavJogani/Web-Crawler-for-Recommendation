String literals consist of the double quote character (") (ASCII 34, hex 0x22), zero or more characters (including Unicode characters), followed by a terminating double quote character ("), such as:"Ceci est une string."
So a string literal follows the following grammar:

<STRINGÂ :
        "\""
        (    (~["\"","\\","\n","\r"])
        |("\\"
            ( ["n","t","b","r","f","\\","'","\""]
            |["0"-"7"](["0"-"7"])?
            |["0"-"3"]["0"-"7"]["0"-"7"]
            )
        )
        )*
        "\"">

Within string and character literals, the backslash character can be used to escape special characters, such asunicode escape sequences, or the following special characters:

String literals may not contain unescaped newline or linefeed characters. However, the Java compiler will evaluate compile time expressions, so the following String expression results in a string with three lines of text:
