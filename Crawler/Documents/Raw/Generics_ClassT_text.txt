Since Java 1.5, the classjava.lang.Classis generic. It is an interesting example of using generics for something other than a container class.
For example, the type of String.class isClass<String>, and the type of Serializable.class isClass<Serializable>. This can be used to improve the type safety of your reflection code.
In particular, since thenewInstance()method in Class now returns T, you can get more precise types when creating objects reflectively.
Now we can use thenewInstance()method to return a new object with exact type, without casting. An example with generics:


The same code without generics:
