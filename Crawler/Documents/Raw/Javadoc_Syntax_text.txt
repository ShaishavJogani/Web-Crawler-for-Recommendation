A documentation comment is framed by slash-star-star and star-slash (i.e. /** ... */). The documentation is in the HTML format.


A documentation comment is placed just above the commented entity (class, constructor, method, field).
In a documentation comment, the first part is a description text in the HTML format. The second part is a list of special attributes whose name starts with an at sign (@):


Get the sum of two integers.Description of the sum method.@param a The first integer number.Description attribute of the parameter a of the method.@param b The second integer number.Description attribute of the parameter b of the method.@return The value of the sum of the two given integers.Description attribute of the value returned by the method.

Here is a non exhaustive list of special attributes:
