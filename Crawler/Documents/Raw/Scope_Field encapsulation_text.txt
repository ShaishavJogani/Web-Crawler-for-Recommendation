Generally, it is best to make data private or protected.  Access to the data is controlled bysetterandgettermethods.  This lets the programmer control access to data, allowing him/her to check for and handle invalid data.


In thecode section 3.51, thesetName()method will only change the value ofnameif the new name is not null.  BecausesetName()is conditionally changing name, it is wise to return a boolean to let the program know if the change was successful.
