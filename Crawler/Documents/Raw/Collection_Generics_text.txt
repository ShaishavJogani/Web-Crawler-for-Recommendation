Objects put into a collection are upcasted to theObjectclass. This means that you need to cast the object reference back when you get an element out of the collection. It also means thatyou need to knowthe type of the object when you take it out. If a collection contains different types of objects, we will have difficulty finding out the type of the objects obtained from a collection at run time. For example. let's use this collection with two objects in it:



This error could have been found earlier, at compile time, by using generic types. TheGenericshave been added since JDK version 1.5. It is an enhancement to the type system of the Java language.  All collection implementations since 1.5 now have aparameterized type <E>.  TheErefers to anElementtype.  When a collection is created, the actualElement typewill replace the E.  In the collection, the objects are now upcasted toEclass.


ageListis a collection that can contain only Integer objects as elements. No casting is required when we take out an element.


Generics are not mandatory but are is often used with the collection classes.
