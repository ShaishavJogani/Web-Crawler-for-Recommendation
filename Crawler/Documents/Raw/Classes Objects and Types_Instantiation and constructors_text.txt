In order to get from class to object, we "build" our object byinstantiation. Instantiation simply means to create aninstanceof a class. Instance and object are very similar terms and are sometimes interchangeable, but remember that an instance refers to aspecific object, which was created from a class.
This instantiation is brought about by one of the class's methods, called aconstructor. As its name implies, a constructor builds the object based on the blueprint. Behind the scenes, this means that computer memory is being allocated for the instance, and values are being assigned to the data members.
In general there are four constructor types: default, non-default, copy, and cloning.
Adefault constructorwill build the most basic instance. Generally, this means assigning all the fields values like null, zero, or an empty string. Nothing would stop you, however, from setting the color of your default sports car color to red, but this is generally bad programming style. Another programmer would be confused if your basic car came out red instead of say, colorless.


Anon-default constructoris designed to create an object instance with prescribed values for most, if not all, of the object's fields. The car is red, goes from 0-60 in 12 seconds, tops out at 190mph, etc.


Acopy constructoris not included in the Java language, however one can easily create a constructor that does the same as a copy constructor. It's important to understand what it is. As the name implies, a copy constructor creates a new instance to be a duplicate of an already existing one. In Java, this can be also accomplished by creating the instance with the default constructor, and then using the assignment operator to equivocate them. This is not possible in all languages though, so just keep the terminology under your belt.
Java has the concept ofcloning an object, and the end results are similar to the copy constructor. Cloning an object is faster than creation with thenewkeyword, because all the object memory is copied at once to the destination cloned object. This is possible by implementing theCloneableinterface, which allows the methodObject.clone()to perform a field-by-field copy.
