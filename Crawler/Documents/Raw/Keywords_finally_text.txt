finallyis a keyword which is an optional ending part of thetryblock.


The code inside the finally block will always be executed. This is also true for cases when there is an exception or even executedreturnstatement in the try block.
Three things can happen in a try block. First, no exception is thrown:


You can see that we have passed in thetryblock, then we have executed thefinallyblock and we have continued the execution. Now, a caught exception is thrown:


We have passed in thetryblock until where the exception occurred, then we have executed the matchingcatchblock, thefinallyblock and we have continued the execution. Now, an uncaught exception is thrown:


We have passed in thetryblock until where the exception occurred and we have executed thefinallyblock.NO CODEafter the try-catch block has been executed. If there is an exception that happens before the try-catch block, thefinallyblock is not executed.
Ifreturnstatement is used inside finally, it overrides the return statement in the try-catch block.  For instance, the construct


will return 12, not 11. Professional code almost never contains statements that alter execution order (likereturn,break,continue) inside the finally block, as such code is more difficult to read and maintain.
