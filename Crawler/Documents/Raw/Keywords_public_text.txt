publicis a Javakeywordwhich declares a member'saccessas public. Public members are visible to all other classes. This means that any other class can access apublicfield or method. Further, other classes can modifypublicfields unless the field is declared asfinal.
A best practice is to give fieldsprivateaccess and reservepublicaccess to only the set of methods andfinalfields that define the class' public constants. This helps with encapsulation and information hiding, since it allows you to change the implementation of a class without affecting the consumers who use only the public API of the class.
Below is an example of an immutablepublicclass namedLengthwhich maintainsprivateinstance fields namedunitsandmagnitudebut provides apublicconstructor and twopublicaccessor methods.
