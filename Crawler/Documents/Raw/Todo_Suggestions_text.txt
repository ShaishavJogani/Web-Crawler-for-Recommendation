Get rid of all the table of content (TOC) templates.The book needs to have dedicated sections. Yoursuggestionsare welcome.I would certainly think it a good idea adding the sections beginner, intermediate and advance.Why can't we have a table of contents and index that tie together the entire book as a reference, and then three extra pages as road-maps for "Begginer", "Intermediate" and "Advanced" ?Skill order (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) is a good idea but it is better to follow this order implicitly rather than explicitly. Cutting the book into three parts that doesn't follow the topics makes no sense. The topics will naturally be listed from the basics to the advanced concept.Ftiercel(discuss•contribs) 21:49, 5 November 2012 (UTC)I don't see what purpose this would serve other than to confuse beginners. If this book is dedicated towards newbies then it should be structured in a way suited to them. --Mattylaws(discuss•contribs) 13:36, 19 August 2012 (UTC)I suggest adding in some information about the Grrenfoot program.  It is a slightly easier way for newcomers to Java to learn how to program games.
