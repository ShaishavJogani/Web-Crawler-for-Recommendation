Synchronization is important when you are running several threads. Beware, synchronization does not mean that your collection is thread-safe. A thread-safe collection is also called aconcurrent collection. Most of the popular collection classes have implementations for both single thread and multiple thread environments. The non-synchronized implementations are always faster. You can use the non-synchronized implementations in multiple thread environments, when you make sure that only one thread updates the collection at any given time.
A new Java JDK package was introduced at Java 1.5, that isjava.util.concurrent.  This package supplies a few Collection implementations designed for use in multi-threaded environments.
The following table lists all the synchronized collection classes:
