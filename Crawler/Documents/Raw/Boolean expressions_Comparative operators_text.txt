Java has several operators that can be used to compare variables.  For example, how would you tell if one variable has a greater value than another?  The answer: use the "greater-than" operator.
Here is a list of the comparative operators in Java:

>: Greater than<: Less than>=: Greater than or equal to<=: Less than or equal to==: Equal to!=: Not equal to

To see how these operators are used, look at this example:


Comparative operators can be used on any primitive types (exceptboolean), but only the "equals" and "does not equal" operators work on objects.  This is because the less-than/greater-than operators cannot be applied to objects, but the equivalency operators can.

Specifically, the==and!=operators test whether both variables point to the same object.  Objects will be covered later in the tutorial, in the "Classes, Objects, and Types" module.
