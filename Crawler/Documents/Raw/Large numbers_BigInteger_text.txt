TheBigIntegerclass represents integers of almost any size. As with other objects, they need to be constructed.  Unlike regular numbers, theBigIntegerrepresents an immutable object - methods in use by theBigIntegerclass will return a new copy of aBigInteger.
To instantiate aBigInteger, you can create it from either byte array, or from a string.  For example:


BigIntegercannot use the normalJava operators. They use the methods provided by the class.


It is possible to convert to along, but thelongmay not be large enough.
