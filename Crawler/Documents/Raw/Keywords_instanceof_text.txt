instanceofis a keyword.
It checks if an object reference is an instance of a type, and returns a boolean value;
The <object-reference>instanceofObjectwill return true for all non-null object references, since all Java objects are inherited fromObject.instanceofwill always returnfalseif <object-reference> isnull.
Syntax:

<object-reference>instanceofTypeName

For example:


Run the program:

java Test

The output:

"It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Apple""It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Apple""It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Orange""It is a Java Object and It is a Fruit and it is an Orange"

Note that theinstanceofoperator can also be applied to interfaces. 
For example, if the example above was enhanced with the interface



and the classes modified such that they implemented this interface



we could ask if our object were edible.
