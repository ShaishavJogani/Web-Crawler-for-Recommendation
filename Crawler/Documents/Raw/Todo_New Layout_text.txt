I'm going to have a crack at suggesting a possible outline for the book.

Introduction/Preface- Contains introduction material to the book, including mentions of contributors and styles and conventions used throughout.Setup- Start preparing the users' computer, installing JDK and explaining the technology that is Java, I'd like to see some mentions of other operating systems such as Unix and Unix Like systems seeing as Java is designed to be a cross platform language.Beginner- basic program flow, get the user used to the syntax of Java, maybe treat this chapter as an introduction to programming in general, giving an introduction to object orientated programming.Intermediate- this could be a good starting point for people who have programmed before, but switching to Java, talking about various core aspects and features of the API.Advance- Revisiting some topics mentioned before, but in greater depth. Talking about things like RMI, Corba.IndexAppendix- Keywords, references, bibliography and other stuff worth mentioningSkill order (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced) is a good idea but it is better to follow this order implicitly rather than explicitly. Cutting the book into three parts that doesn't follow the topics makes no sense. The topics will naturally be listed from the basics to the advanced concept. So theBeginner,IntermediateandAdvancedtopics should be replaced byLanguage fundamentals,Classes and objects,Collections,Exceptions,Concurrent Programming,Javadoc & Annotations,Byte Code.Ftiercel(discussâ€¢contribs) 21:49, 5 November 2012 (UTC)
