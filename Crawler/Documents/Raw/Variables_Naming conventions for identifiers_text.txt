When naming identifiers, you need to use the following guidelines which ensure that your variables are named accurately. As we discussed earlier, we should always name our variables in a way that tells us what they hold. Consider this example:


Do you know what this program does? Well, it multiplies two values. That much you guessed right. But, do you know what those values are? Exactly, you don't. Now consider this code:


Now you can tell what's happening, can't you? However, before we continue, notice thecaseof the variables. If a word contains CAPITAL LETTERS, it is inUPPER CASE. If a word has small letters, it is inlower case. Both cases in a word renders it asmIxEd CaSe.
The variables we studied so far had a mixed case. When there are two or more words making up the names of a variable, you need to use a special case called thecamel-case. Just like the humps of a camel, your words need to stand out. Using this technique, the wordsfirstandnamecould be written as eitherfirstNameorFirstName.
The first instance,firstNameis what we use as the names of variables. Remember though,firstNameis not the same asFirstNamebecause Java iscase-sensitive. Case-sensitive basically implies that the case in which you wrote one word is the case you have to call that word in when using them later on. Anything other than that is not the same as you intended. You'll know more as you progress. You can hopefully tell now why the variables you were asked to identify weren't proper.
