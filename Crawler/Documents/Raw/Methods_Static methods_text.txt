Astatic methodis a method that can be called without an object instance. It can be called on the class directly. For example, thevalueOf(String)method of theIntegerclass is a static method:


The static keyword makes attributes instance-agnostic. This means that you cannot reference a static attribute of a single object (because such a specific object attribute doesn't exist). Instead, only one instance of a static attribute exists, whether there is one object in the JVM or one hundred. Here is an example of using a static attribute in a static method:


You can notice that when you useSystem.out.println(),outis a static attribute of theSystemclass. A static attribute is related to a class, not to any object instance. This is how Java achieves one universal output stream that we can use to print output. Here is a more complex use case:
